0,"The Metro is a fantastic hotel. The central location allows me to walk everywhere as I explore this vibrant city. The hotel and rooms are adorned with stunning paintings and artwork. Each room is different, all full of character and immaculate. I pride myself in having the fortune of staying in a number different rooms during a few recent trips. The gorgeous people at the from desk are never too busy to make recommendations to optimise my stay, further my knowledge of the area, and make me feel at home. The hotel is also perfectly placed for delicious restaurants, cafe's, shops, and bars in the neighbourhood. A friend in London originally recommended The Metro to me and it’s a tremendous find. The price is reasonable and I haven’t found anything which compares in San Francisco. This is my go to SF hotel and home away from home. I can’t wait to get back there. Well done and a million thanks!",4-Jul-19,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
1,"My partner and I absolutely loved this hotel! There are son many good points about it I've struggled to know where to start. The location is perfect, there are so many restauarants and shops around you. You're within walking distance to the painted ladies and there are multiple tram and bus stops only steps away. The people on the front desk were so friendly and helpful, saying hello and wishing us a nice time each time we came in and out of the hotel. They were more than happy to help us navigate the tram map they gave us for free. The artwork throughout the hotel was beautiful. We stayed in room 102. We were a bit worried that it would be a bit small but it was just right. Yes, the bed was the tiniest bit cramped but we didn't care. The view out to Divisadero street was lovely, watching the hubbub of San Francisco from the comfort of your room was awesome. Hopefully one day we will come back to America and back to San Francisco and we can stay here again. Thank you Metro Hotel and all of your staff for making our stay awesome!",24-Jun-19,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
2,"We had three nights and enjoyed our stay!The staff was friendly and very obliging.The room was small, but big enough for two and very clean. Nothing to complain!We are looking forward for the next time!",13-Jun-19,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
3,"Great location if you are planning on enjoying Golden Gate Park. Was able to walk to many SF locations. Great food in the area. It's no thrills, but rooms are cute & clean and staff is friendly. I was on the top floor and did not mind not having a lift. Would certainly stay again.",10-Jun-19,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
4,"Originally very hesitant to book this hotel but so glad we did! Very clean & comfortable - no lift but knew this prior to booking so selected a 1st floor room (111). Great bed, small but adequate en-suite, small wardrobe. Ceiling fan/Heater. Would have liked a fridge but survived without one as most of our time spent sightseeing. MUNI bus stop very close by, approximately 15 minutes via bus to downtown. Lovely owners, helpful staff. Great rates. Would happily return & recommend to anyone looking for reasonably priced accommodation in SF.",8-Jun-19,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
5,"We booked here for 4 nights after being recommended to it by a friend who had loved their recent stay. We even cancelled another hotel we had booked and we are SO GLAD we did because the Metro is fantastic!From our arrival, where we were greeted by the nicest lady on reception (I think her name was Angie), to our departure, where we were warmly seen off by, I think, possibly the owner (extremely beautiful lady with amazing make up skills who was a DELIGHT!) everything was tip-top. I must have mentioned upon booking that we were celebrating my birthday - when we arrived into our room after a long transatlantic journey, there was a lovely, bright birthday card and a big Toblerone waiting for me - what a nice surprise!Our room was a large one at the front on the second floor, with two huge comfortable double beds and a small but perfectly formed bathroom. The shower was powerful and with plenty of hot water any time we needed it and a lovely additional touch of Trader Joe shampoo, conditioner and body wash. A hairdryer is also provided, along with plenty of room in the bathroom for all our bits and bobs. A separate toilet is a great idea - no bathroom hogging in the mornings from my partner!All areas of the hotel were clean and tidy and the area felt perfectly safe, even at night. There are lots of great places to eat and drink a short walk away - our favourites were Black Sands brewery and 4505 BBQ. Some really nice boutique stores locally, too.The location is a great one to explore from - a bus stop is right around the corner for the 6 which takes you down to Market Street to get a cable car, for example. It's also quite walkable for Haight and Golden Gate Park and the Painted Ladies are not far (I say walkable, just don't forget all those hills!).Sleep-wise, despite being on a main busy road, we didn't feel it was overly noisy. In fact, thanks to the room and our flight times from the UK, we slid right in to great sleep pattern and no jet lag, which is not something we usually manage on our frequent trips to the USA!The room had ample space to store our clothes, a TV with lots of cable channels and most importantly in this day and age - great and reliable fast wifi!The staff were only too happy to make recommendations and suggestions for places to eat and things to see and everyone had a cheery hello or goodbye when leaving and coming back for the day. I genuinely cannot think of a better place to stay in San Francisco and that's before we even get to the financials - this is GREAT VALUE! San Francisco is one of the most expensive cities on the planet but somehow this place delivers on that front too. HATS OFF, GUYS! Overall, would and will highly recommend this place to everyone and of course, will definitely be back to stay again when we are next in SF. Thanks so much to all the staff for their efforts in making our stay a memorable one!",27-May-19,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
6,"We stayed 7 nights at The Metro Hotel. Found it clean, quiet and friendly. Lovely shower and very comfortable bed.Ideal for exploring. Walkable to panhandle end of Golden Gate park. Bus stops very near hotel were easy to use and we bought a clipper card. Bus trips only $2.50 per time. Uber to airport on final day was $21.77.We stayed in Room 208. Fairly small but very quiet at back of hotel overlooking a small courtyard garden so away from road noise.No coffee making facilities in room but nice coffee shop 3 doors up from hotel which we used each morning. Pizza restaurant right next door was excellent but very busy and you can't book.",26-May-19,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
7,"We have stayed at The Metro Hotel over the past five years whenever we have visited family in San Francisco. It is our 'go to' hotel because we feel safe, the rooms are spotlessly clean, very reasonably priced, and the staff is personable, friendly, helpful and accommodating. We always recommend this hotel to our friends that are visiting San Francisco.",14-May-19,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
8,"This is a very good hotel in a great location. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room itself was spotless. As breakfast wasn't an option, a coffee machine would have been a nice touch, but that is a minor gripe. It was both a great place base for exploring San Francisco and to come back to in the evening, with numerous excellent coffee shops, bars and restaurants; check out Nopa, The Little Chihuahua, Barvale, Ragazza, Vinyl Cafe, etc, etc; all on the doorstep.",15-Apr-19,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
9,"It was a lovely little hotel, and the staff were super friendly. Room was a little small, but we did see larger rooms so might be a good idea to request a big room when booking. Good location, right next to Haight St, I think it was about a 20 min walk or so into the city. But it’s nice to walk around the neighbourhoods. The Italian next door and the Thai across the road is highly recommend!

10,"My husband and I stayed here during a consultation appointment at UCSF. The staff was WONDERFUL. They recommended places to eat that were affordable, remembered when we had to be at the hospital and just overall seemed to care that our stay was comfortable. I overhead them giving other customers great detailed information on tourist activities. They really go the extra mile to make your visit pleasant.",30-Mar-19,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
11,"As others have said,this is not an Uber smart hotel and our room(114) was not big but everything was very clean and comfortable, particularly the bed. The staff could not be more friendly and helpful, whatever time of the day. We loved the location, close to the 1960s hippy district. Bus travel downtown is very easy and cheap. You can easily walk to golden gate park. There are some excellent places to eat and a couple of supermarkets close by.we would have liked to be able to make hot drinks in the room. There are no facilities to do this but there is an excellent coffee shop a couple of doors down which opens at 7 in the morning. This is a great place to stay for an ‘authentic’ stay in SF. Our room was very quiet and we cannot thank the staff enough for their kindness during our stay.",23-Mar-19,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
12,"For the price paid, I would highly recommend this quaint little hotel for a short stay in San Fran. It is situated a very convenient 30 minutes away from most tourist spots via public transport and is in a very safe and nice little neighbourhood. Staff were very helpful during our stay which we appreciated. We also liked the little touches at the hotel including umbrellas provided on wet days! The room was a little small, but fine for the two of us for a couple of nights!",19-Mar-19,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
13,I recently visited with my grandparents to take my grandma for her chemo treatments and they were so polite and my grandma loves sitting and talking with them I even went down and talked the the owner and her daughter they are both so helpful I would recommend you to stay here fabulous service and full with super friendly people ,31-Jan-19,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
14,"I actually hate writing a review, selfishly, because I’m afraid to let people know about this place. The staff is upbeat, friendly and helpful. The beds are so comfortable and the location is fantastic. The hotel is warm and feels like home. I really can’t say enough about this place. We love it!",29-Jan-19,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
15,"I would not classify this a hotel. It looks more like a hostel. The room was really, small, street noise was constant, walls are thin and the area of town was not as I would have pictured. The staff tried best, but this is a budget hostel.",12-Jan-19,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
16,Love everything bout our stay in the Metro. Peeps at front desk are particularly commendable especially Angela and Harold who are friendly and helpful with recommendations (best Mexican we’ve ever had and the Canopy View Trail at Muir was just the perfect choice for us) who gave us such great impression bout SF. xoxo,23-Dec-18,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
17,"We stayed 4 x nights at the Metro hotel and absolutely loved our stay. The rooms are cosy, clean and secure and we cannot give enough thanks to Angela on the front desk who was so welcoming, smiley, polite and lovely from the first moment we walked in. Thank you very much Angela and the Metro hotel for making our stay in San Fran as perfect as ever!! <3",13-Dec-18,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
18,"The Metro is a warm, welcoming family-owned hotel and my go-to when I'm visiting my daughter who lives in the Upper Haight. Just came back from my latest visit, where I stayed in room 206 for three nights. The staff, including Shayna and Angela, are so friendly that I found myself chatting with them on my way in and out, like you would with a friend. The key things I'm looking for in a hotel are cleanliness, comfortable bed, fluffy pillows, and comfortable sleeping conditions, e.g., ceiling fan, and the Metro delivers on all of these points. The bathroom and shower are clean as well, and they don't overlook the little things, like shampoo, body wash, hand soap, and tissues. Knowing I don't have to pack some of those things is really helpful. When I did have a little trouble getting the overhead light to turn off but wanted the fan to stay on, I called Angela at the front desk and she walked me through the troubleshooting (it was an easy fix). I highly recommend the Metro Hotel for those wanting a clean, affordable stay in a happening area!",29-Oct-18,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
19,"I wasn't expecting much when I booked a hotel in San Francisco for a hundred bucks a night; but, in this instance I was pleasantly surprised. The room is small. Two people would find it a tight squeeze. Simply furnished, no bedside lamps but ceiling lights. Bed is small, but comfortable. Bath is tight, shower is small. Plenty of hangers, but no drawers. Shelves in closet are high but you are given a pouf to stand on to reach them. Twenty-four hour staff is young and friendly. Neighborhood is convenient, walkable and chock full of interesting restaurants and shops. Lobby is comfortable. Garden is usable only until five pm after which it becomes a part of a neighboring restaurant. No elevator and steep stairs. Overall, clean, efficient, affordable, friendly. I booked again for next June.",22-Oct-18,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
20,"Who said chivalry is dead? When I booked the Metro (at 1/3 the cost of other San Francisco hotels), I never would have guessed that this old fashioned, brownstone style boutique hotel would leave such a strong impression on us.Its charm and comfort was second only to the owner’s attentiveness and genuine hospitality. Shana, thanks for making our visit so magical❤️ Wendy and Jon room 111",13-Oct-18,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
21,"I spent 11 days overall, with my partner at the Metro Hotel in September and without a doubt, our vacation would not have been as good, if we hadn't. Aside from being everything you want from a hotel, in a great location for exploring this city and short walks from the Castro district and Golden Gate Park, what sets this hotel apart from the rest is the people who work and manage the place. From the moment we arrived Angela was so unbelievably welcoming, friendly and professional. We asked a lot of questions about things to do and using the public transport system and the help and advice we got allowed us to get around the city easily and see some amazing places. Shana gave us incredible trip suggestions both in SF and onwards to LA and personally helped make my birthday a fantastic night. Everyone who helps run the Metro Hotel went far beyond any expectations to make sure our stay was the best. We believe they all have such genuinely good hearts, that I can honestly say we miss being there. Book the Metro Hotel with confidence and have the best time, in the city we left our hearts in.",7-Oct-18,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
22,"We only stayed one night, but my adult nieces loved the area, we took several walks, very convenient to restaurants and parks, makes you feel as though you're living in the neighborhood. We used the small back patio to have a glass of champagne, very pretty. No parking but easy rideshares to other neighborhoods available. Best thing was Shana, so friendly and helpful, whose father painted all of the wonderful art in the lobby and many of the rooms. Also a very clean hotel, which I much appreciate. Couldn't beat the prices of the rooms, either (we had 2). Definitely coming back!",3-Oct-18,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
23,"This hotel is in a fab location. We had the largest room at the front of the hotel, which was beautifully decorated. There is also a terrace at the back to enjoy in the evening. The only thing that stopped this getting 5 stars was the parking. If, like us you are on a road trip and need to park your car then prepare yourself. We asked at reception about parking and were told oh you can use residential, just drive around for a little bit and you will find one! 2 hours after we arrived and we were still driving around looking for a parking space. We only managed to get one because we found a spot but had to leave before 6am. The staff / hotel could have been much more helpful. You guys are the locals - it would be helpful if you could give addresses of local 24 hour parking rather than being left to drive around for 2 hours. It left us no time to enjoy the evening and by the time we got to the room we were all fed up and wanted to go to bed. If you are not driving then this hotel is great !",2-Oct-18,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
24,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Metro.Two major pluses : the price and location. By SF standards, this hotel was very affordable compared to other hotels closer to the city center. And being right on Divisadero, we found a good mix of places to have coffee and breakfast and to have dinner. It was a quick walk to the bus stops we needed to get to. Our room was small, but comfortable and very clean. The shower was also small, but the towels were especially thick and plush.There is no fridge in the room, but the front desk was happy to hold food in the lobby refrigerator for us. If you need an ironing board, they have that too. Every staff member we encountered was super friendly. Returning at the end of each day, we were always greeted with a warm welcome. When in SF, The Metro is the place to stay.",28-Sep-18,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
25,"Stayed here for 3 nights in September. Hotel is in a great area and costs about 30$ by Uber from the airport. Only on street parking nearby. All the staff without exception were so friendly and helpful. They were able to help us organise our trips out around the city and where to eat. The room was spotlessly clean with maid service each day. Toiletries were provided and a ceiling fan rather than aircon. There is no safe in the room or coffee machine which was a bind as having to carry your valuables everywhere. There isn’t a fridge either and the bathroom door slides on runners in the ceiling which was difficult to close/open.The hotel is on a main road and unfortunately at about 4am each day the main shop bins are emptied and a few minutes later the streets are cleaned. I appreciate this isn’t the hotels fault but something to be mindful of. The public transport is very good in the city and buses stop a short distance away. Get the 6 or 7 into downtown for 2-75$ each, you do need the correct change. When booking I remember that this hotel came up at a reasonable price compared to many others. I would give it 5 stars if the few points mentioned were addressed but again the staff were so helpful and I would like to thank them.",19-Sep-18,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html

27,"We were in SF for 3 days and chose this hotel since we were on a budget but wanted a clean place with private bathroom etc.... we were not disappointed. The staff were very helpful and I was able to borrow a plate and knife to use while packing lunch to enjoy at Golden Gate Park. Room 107 was small but worked for the 2 of us and had a good bed and a good sized bathroom with great water pressure (& Trader Joe shampoo, conditioner and body wash). The towels were replaced and room cleaned each day. It’s a bit far from some main tourist attractions but public transportation and Lyft are easily accessible. Felt perfectly safe even at night. We walked a lot - it was a great way to get to know the area. Tons of affordable cafes, bars and restaurants nearby. If we come back to SF we’ll stay here again.",15-Sep-18,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html

They also gave us toiletries such as toothbrushes, toothpaste and a cleansing bar when our luggage didn't arrive with us on the plane.The hotel room was clean and the area felt safe.

I'll definitely come again!",19-Aug-18,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
34,"Stayed in room 115, which sleeps three and is located at the rear of the hotel. Pros: Staff is excellent-knowledgeable, friendly, helpful. Room was quiet (except at dinner time for the restaurant next door, that has a gazebo in the hotels garden). Nicely appointed room with enough room for 3 of us. Shampoo, conditioner, body wash were provided. The price of the room enabled us (on a tight budget) to stay in the city. The neighborhood was great, in that there were many restaurants within walking distance. Cons: Rooms are on the second floor and there is no elevator. Parking is a challenge. We could usually find a spot in the neighborhood, but working around the 2 hour max and street sweeping days was challenging. There are pay parking garages nearby, but they looked expensive. The shower in 115 was small. You will want to bring a shower cap if you don’t want your hair to get wet. And bring your own Charmin if you want better than commercial grade toilet paper.

They had excellent ideas about places to see and how to navigate the city. When we returned from a trip they always asked about our experience.

The staff members are very welcoming and were very informative in helping us plan our stay by recommending things to see and do on a map and the easiest ways to get their by public transport. Our room was compact but very clean and comfortable with everything we needed, in addition to having funky decor. The location is excellent as there are lots of cool restaurants along Divisadero St. and amenities as well. We had a great time walking up and down this street and trying out a different place to eat. It's also within walking distance of Haight Ashbury, Painted Ladies and buses to get you downtown.

37,Stayed for 3 nights. We stayed in the largest room for 5 people. Very big and comfortable beds. Was very quiet . A couple of restaurants nearby. Next door is Ragazza. Good pizza. Their is also a little supermarket about block away. We didn't take transportation because we ubered. It was cheaper for us. We walked to Chinatown. About 3 miles.

38,"Stayed at The Metro for two nights with my family of five. From my booking, trying to accommodate five people, to giving us exploring/restaurant tips, Shana went up and beyond your normal advice to make sure we enjoyed our first trip to San Francisco. You can tell she really cares about The Metro, it’s guest, and the city. The hotel itself also has a great vibe with its historic charm. I worried about the location not ever traveling to SF, but it ended up being perfect. The lower Haight location gives you that spot when you get up in the morning you have 5-10 cafes or bakery within a 1-2 minute walk. While we enjoyed every part of San Francisco walking around this area (painted ladies and Golden Gate Park) may have been the best part.

The bedding was crisp and comfortable. There is great food close by in all directions. You are walking distance to some of the best parks on earth here.

40,"My husband and I along with our best friends stayed at this boutique hotel for our wedding and honeymoon. Most of our time was spent away from the hotel exploring the city so the ammenities were perfect for our needs. Any issues were incredibly minor and immediately remedied by the wonderful staff. We stayed in room 101 at the front of the hotel. Great people watching spot through the beautiful ceiling to floor windows. Comfy beds, extremely clean. Fresh fluffy clean towels everyday. We returned to wine and chocolates in the room along with a super sweet card upon our return from our wedding.Great breakfast, brunch, coffee/tea and lunch spots within close walking distance. The Italian restaurant next door has some of the best pizza around. HUGE thank you to Shayna and the staff for being so helpful with suggestions and directions. You guys were huge in making our wedding trip a great success. Will definitely recommend and return whenever I'm in the city. Many Thanks!,Mary & Jeff Sellars ",12-Jul-18,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
41,"We took a family trip to San Francisco (needed two rooms) and were so happy to find ourselves at the Metro Hotel. The neighborhood was safe and had many amenities including retail, restaurants, and a laundromat in the immediate vicinity. These things made our stay that much easier.The room sizes were efficient without feeling cramped which is what we expected. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfy. One room had a view of the street with bay windows that could be opened for a cool breeze.The service at the Metro was outstanding. It is a family owned and operated hotel which is always appealing to us. Every one of the front desk attendants were friendly and knowledgeable. The owner's daughter was a joy to speak with. She helped us with parking solutions (no parking tickets... yay), restaurant recommendations (tasty), and an idea for getting around the city that was simple and cost-efficient (saw so many great sites).If we return to San Francisco, we would definitely book at the Metro again.",2-Jul-18,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
42,"If you want a delightfully authentic San Francisco experience and you don't have unlimited funds, this is by far the best place to stay. That's why many of the guests, like me, stay here every time we come back to San Francisco, which for some of us is our hometown. There's a beautiful garden in back that provides peaceful relaxation. The rooms are very clean and nicely appointed with the sort of very comfortable beds and high quality bedding travelers rarely find except in 4 star or better hotels. The free WiFi is fast. Gorgeous, original art works created by Ted Soulis, the famous San Franciscan whose family still owns the hotel, decorate the walls in the public areas and the rooms. You can ask for and get a very quiet room, yet you are in a lively neighborhood filled with nice cafes, restaurants, bars, and shops. You can get very inexpensive and delicious meals at many nearby restaurants and two excellent delis, Falletti's and Bi-Rite, ideal for anyone who wants fresh local food with no preparation hassle! The attentive desk clerks (on duty 24/7) treat you like a dear friend and can advise you on where to go and the easiest ways to get there. Several popular tourist attractions are within walking distance. Within a few blocks there are many frequent service buses that can take you almost anywhere in The City and to various BART light rail stations. The prices are comparable to -- and usually better than -- those of short term rentals in any reasonably safe areas, and you are never left on your own to deal with problems, the way you are in a short term rental apartment. For those who care about the homeless, you can sleep guilt-free at night knowing you have not contributed to San Francisco's housing crisis by selfishly occupying an apartment that has been taken off the rental market. The Metro makes it very pleasant to do the right thing!",27-Jun-18,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
43,We arrived at the Metro very late on our first night in San Fran. We were met with a very friendly front desk attendant. The rooms were comfortable clean and affordable. The hotel felt homey! I had mentioned it was my boyfriends 30th birthday in the booking as the reason for our trip and they went out of their way to give him a birthday treat and a birthday card welcoming us to the city and signed from all their staff. It was a much appreciated and unexpected personal touch. We only spent one night here but wished we had stayed longer!,23-Jun-18,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
44,"I stayed at The Metro for 3 nights in May 2018, choosing it largely because it was so affordable for San Francisco. Having stayed now, it’s clear this gem of a hotel is incredible value.There was a lot to like about my stay, but the wonderful staff working at the hotel are what made it so enjoyable. Radiating warmth, so friendly, full of advice about San Fran & areas to visit, but also just happily sitting down & chatting with guests to make them feel welcome. They added a lovely personal element that is just lost on many hotels. I would stay there again based on the staff alone.As to the hotel itself, the location to me was ideal. It is out of the main city area, but the Haight Ashbury area is a lot calmer & safer than the city center, & the public transport options so close to the hotel meant you could get anywhere quickly. There are plenty of great restaurant, bar & cafe options nearby, & the hotel is well located for a quick trip to visit some key areas like Golden Gate Park, the Painted Ladies, & the Castro.I stayed in room 201. It looks out on the street but I didn’t find the light or noise too bad. It was a bit of a climb getting to the room as there is no elevator, but the hotel is very clear & up front about this on their site & in email correspondence & it wasn’t a concern for me.The room was a little on the small side, particularly the bathroom. However it was well decorated & attractive, & immaculately clean. The extended bar/table with chairs overlooking the street is a good touch.If you’re mobile & happy to climb stairs to get to your room, I would whole heartedly recommend The Metro. I will definitely be staying again if I get the chance to visit San Fran again in the future.",10-Jun-18,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
45,"Pre booked this hotel months ago after reading good reviews on here. At the time of booking there were only a limited number of rooms left, and it showed you online which rooms they had with a description of each. The hotel was in the Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco which is the hippy area. The hotel had a large bed and although the room was quite small, it had a wall mounted tv and a large bathroom with full bottles of shampoo conditioner and body wash. There are no lifts in the property so you will have to carry bags up the stairs. We arrived at around 2pm (an hour before official hotel check in) but the receptionist Shanna checked us in straight away and gave us vouchers to get discount on the big bus tour. She also recommended loads of places for us to eat and drink and how to use the public transport. She was so lovely and helpful. Would definitely recommend this hotel to first time tourists like ourselves.

46,"The Metro Hotel is everything promised and more. It's not luxe, in that there is no elevator nor coffeemaker in your room (who needs one, there are fabulous coffee options on every corner nearby!) and the rooms are on the smaller side but that did not detract AT ALL from our stay. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the shower was the best! If TV and wifi are your thing, both are available and free.The location is convenient--we walked and affordably ride-shared wherever we needed to be but there is bus service nearby as well. Shayna was so helpful in her recommendations and made us feel welcome every time we walked back in the door.Best value for money and we will return on our next visit to the city.",31-May-18,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
47,"In my opinion, The #1 Best Boutique Hotel in San Francisco. Located in one of the safest areas of the city, with plenty of busy coffee houses and right over a fantastic Italian restaurant. The owner, Shayna, is a rare person who loves making people feel welcome, as do the staff, Mathew, Angela, Marco, Lori, et al. I loved my stay, appreciate the numerous wonderful paintings by Shayna's father, obviously the fifth member of the ""California Four"" that grace the lobby and rooms. I really enjoyed the triple-pane windows with blinds between the glass, high ceilings, self-dimming lighting controls, Japanese garden, wonderful bed. I would say the quietest hotel room I have ever had in SF. Rooms are small, but so is the price. I observed many guests were returning for their second or third stay, and it is obvious they love the place, too. I will definitely be back. My first choice.

48,"It's not fancy but the rooms are clean and the one we had was a good size. The bed was fine and other facilities such as bathroom perfectly adequate. It's not the Ritz but the price is definitely better than you'll find anywhere else in central San Francisco. The location for us was excellent since it was only two blocks away from our son's condo. Note there are no elevators so you have to carry your bags up a flight or tow of stairs. There are several rooms in the back, so there is no street noise.",9-Apr-18,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
49,"I don't write a ton of reviews. The places I do end up writing about are the ones that I feel so strongly about that I can't imagine not singing their praises to help their business thrive. This place is such a good value, balancing price point, quality, and service, that I really can't imagine staying anywhere else in the city. Not only that, the neighborhood is not very tourist-y. If you want to be near the cable cars, Wharf, or Lombard Street, you may not want to stay here, but if you want to visit the city and enjoy it while you pretend you're a local, this is the spot.

50,"For our first visit to San Francisco, we couldn’t have picked a better hotel. It became our comfortable, welcoming home base. The hotel’s own description is accurate, so if you want a boutique hotel and not a big chain hotel with unneeded amenities, this is the place to choose. Parking a car would be a hassle. Uber anywhere (we did), or use abundant public transportation (we didn’t).",21-Mar-18,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
51,"I stayed at the Metro last week for a vacation I took with my son (9) for spring break. Everyone we encountered at the hotel was friendly and very helpful. I had read the reviews prior to arriving, so was expecting a small room. We stayed in room 202, which is on the 3rd floor with 2 twin beds. There was no elevator, so we had to walk up the stairs (which was fine for us, but just a warning to others). The room was big enough for two people to sleep and store their luggage, and included a TV with a few channels. It reminded me of what a standard European hotel room looks like. The shower was about the size of a broom closet, which worked alright for us but may not work for someone much bigger than me (5'5"" and roughly 150lbs). The shower also had an issue with getting the floor sopping wet and unfortunately the offered rug sucked it up and stayed wet throughout our stay. There were a few issues with stains on the blankets (small black stains, I'm assuming ink of some sort) and there were some hairs in the bathroom that were not from us. Neither of these things bothered me, so I did not tell the hotel about it. I just want to provide an honest and complete review. We faced the street and did not have any issues with noise pollution. The room did have a tendency to feel very stuffy in the afternoons when we returned, but opening the windows and turning the fan on high seemed to work well. I would definitely stay at this location again, it was a great price and super convenient to access public transportation.There are a few reasonable restaurants within walking distance. Takes about 20-30 minutes on the bus to get to the Fisherman's Market.",16-Mar-18,0    The Metro Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d310867-Reviews-The_Metro_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html

We were busy while visiting, so not in the room a lot. It is in a great location, the staff are friendly and helpful. I would stay there again.

53,"Drove in from the valley to have a procedure done at UCSF and needed a comfy place to rest and somewhat close to hospital, before returning home. Couldn’t of picked a better place to stay! All the staff were extremely helpful from the moment I called in to book. They selected a very cozy room for us, and it was immaculate. We woulda never know a family had just stayed for 5 days in that room before us. The first thing you noticed (besides all the amazing art on the walls) was the scent of clean, but not overpowering, which was very ok with me! The beds were so cozy, and the additional heaters in the room were handy to aid in my recovery. Check in was a breeze, where she issued me “real” keys and assisted with my bags up the stairs. Even after a procedure they were easy to climb. The shower came stocked with Trader Joe’s full size, tea tree shampoo/conditioner and body wash, and extra simple amenities were available upon request.. like irons, razors, qtips. The towels smelled fresh, too! Our room had a little bedroom off the main one, Room #110 and I can’t wait to return with my family to this little hotel for fun and more of the best pies from Ragazza pizza, right outside the hotel doors. The evening proprietor even handed us a little map of the convinces on the block! Would been nice to have a little fridge to hold the left overs, but that In no way takes away this hotels charm!

57,"We last visited San Francisco in 2016, and since then hotel prices seem to have gone through the roof! It was whilst searching for something a little cheaper that we came across the San Remo Hotel. It's situated very close to Pier 39, maybe a ten minute walk, so it's perfectly sited for all your SF adventures. Inside, it is probably the quirkiest hotel we've ever visited. The walls are lined with historic pictures and furniture and you could spend a fair while just wandering the corridors looking at these. Some of the rooms are internal, with their windows looking out into the corridor, which is brightly lit by skylights. Ours was at the front of the hotel with a view of the street. It was small but comfortable and clean, with a quiet and efficient ceiling fan and a period sink.There's no ensuite, instead you share toilets and shower or bathrooms with the rest of the floor you are on. This sounds like a downside but in practice there are plenty of them and we never had any problem finding a spare facility when we needed one. In fact, both toilets and showers are quite lovely in their detail, and both supply quality toiletries. Also, at the end of each corridor we found a lay-z-boy massage chair, free to use, which was most welcome after a day cycling over the Golden Gate Bridge!If you are after a budget hotel in SF, you pretty much can't go wrong with this place, so long as you know what to expect.",29-Jun-19,1    San Remo Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81360-Reviews-San_Remo_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html

Good location to hire a bike just around the corner and cycle over the Golden Gate Bridge, amongst other things. The hotel staff were great, friendly and helpful with any query. The rooms and shared showers were exceptionally clean. You had everything you needed on hand, all the way down to ear buds and make-up wipes.. Hot drinks, sweets and chocolates were free to.

The shared showers you walk in a small room and lock the door then the shower is in a next compartment so they are very private to use. Our room was right across from the showers/toilets which was good. The location is fantastic a 5 min walk from fisherman’s wharf/pier 39.The staff were fantastic, we arrived at 10:30/11pm on our first night and the man behind the desk with the longish hair (dark hair I never caught his name) gave us his discount card for ordering a pizza to the hotel this was very nice of him.

The check-in staff were very nice and gave us advice on location, breakfast places where to rent bikes, etc. The hotel is historic and so unique I loved all the plants growing throughout the hotel and all the historic decor. I was hesitant at first about the shared bathroom situation but learned quickly I did not have to fret - the bathrooms were always clean and stocked with warmed towels and so many complimentary amenities (including qtips and makeup remover wipes which was handy). This hotel also has cheap coin laundry and unlimited hot/cold water, tea, and coffee. Also a massage chair!! (After walking up to Lombard street I needed it) I had a outer wall room (meaning I had an actual window) - sleeps were a little rough due to the loud garbage truck every morning at 7:30am but mattress was good, minimal noise from other hotel guests, and my room had a standing fan and ceiling fan so comfort was no issue.

Located only a 5 minute walk away from fisherman’s wharf and the world famous pier 39. A 15 minute walk from pier 33 which is the location of Alcatraz cruises.

I only found human hair during one shower. But other than that, I think they keep them clean. 2) You have to keep in mind that the rooms are extremely small, they do not have air conditioning and the walls are very thins so if you are a light sleeper this could be a problem for you. 3) Also keep in mind that being an old hotel they do not have an elevator, you need to carry the suitcases up like three floors.

There was often a wait for the toilet or shower - I must stress that this didn’t really present a major problem. Everything was clean. Great location for fisherman’s wharf and all the tourist hotspots.

The toilets and showers are at the end of the hall, which worked out alright since you could go upstairs if they were full. The main issue I had was that there was only one sink on the floor, which led to several backups with people brushing teeth, washing hands, washing face, etc. The location was great for exploring Fisherman's Wharf or walking to Coit Tower. There were several good restaurants around as well. The street was also calm enough to pull up a car quickly to unload.

Very kind and knowledge, of what to do/see/eat, in the area. I believe a staff member lives on-site too, so checking in late isn't too much of a hassle. The downsides:-rooms are tiny, only enough to move around in. Most have individual sinks too.-no tv, but plenty of wall plugs, for electronics/beauty appliances.-walls are THIN. You will hear your next door neighbor's convo, even at regular speaking levels. You will hear many outside sounds too. -parking is several blocks away, at the Safeway grocery store. -there is no valet/luggage person, to help you bring stuff up and down, the several stairs.-nothing for kids/teens to do - like a pool or even lounging area. After a certain time, they will get bored or antsy. -community bathrooms and showers, but like I said earlier, you do get used to it all. The decor is fun and unique. You always run into some fun surprise art piece. They serve plenty of coffee/tea/hot cocoa and CANDY all day, with madeline cookies and brownies, in the morning time.You are within walking distance to The Fisherman's Wharf, a bunch of eateries, grocery stores, little Italy and Chinatown.

75,"The San Remo was truly one of the best experiences of my whole trip. There is no hotel like this one! A wonderful hotel in a very central location (north beach). We stayed there for two nights during our trip and felt very well taken care of. The decor and atmosphere of the hotel is incredible. It is decorated with such eye for detail - every room is designed differently and in an individual charming way that tells a unique story. The hotel was built in 1906 and it has preserved a lot of its history. It is well worth walking around the inside and taking in its unique charme and atmosphere. There is free coffee, tea and pastries in the morning, and one of my personal favorites were the massage chairs that are free of charge and a perfect way to unwind after a long day of sightseeing! The staff is very attentive and was really helpful (i had an issue with my return flight and they helped my call the airline and sort it out for me). Make sure to check out the downstairs restaurant too! The pasta is great and it has a cozy atmosphere. All in all, an absolute wonderful stay!

78,"My sister and I spent one night in San Remo to take in the sights of San Francisco en route to Phoenix. We were a bit apprehensive as it was our first time staying in an hotel with shared bathroom and shower. Well ..we needn't have worried!!! There were so many showers and so many toilets on each floor ..but not only that! there were beautifully decorated little alcoves with hand painted sinks providing mouthwash dispensers and cleansing pads, cotton buds etc and soft towels and face cloths. Something interesting to look at or read around every corner. Our bedroom was reminiscent of my granny's that enveloped you with comfort and warmth and having a peek into other rooms they all seem to be individually decorated. There is tea and coffee and snacks available 24 hours. There is even a laundry room. Every member of staff we encountered was so nice and helpful ..especially Aaren who I had been dealing with while booking. She even gave us lovely little momentos of the hotel when we were leaving. The hotel is in a perfect location for sightseeing as you can walk to all the interesting places. If you are looking for your typical modern cloned bedroom that you will find in every hotel in the world ...then this is not for you. If you want a unique beautiful charming warm hotel ...this is it!!!

80,"The hotel is a very budget friendly hotel for where you are located in the city. It’s excellently located beside The wharf, Chinatown, and main downtown area. The hotel property and area is safe. It’s a good location to get to the pier should you wish to take the ferry. Good restaurants near by as well. The hotel is kind of like a hostel for adults just cleaner and quiet. It’s quaint and vintage and has an old world charm. The showers are outside of the room but there are plenty washrooms and showers and they were clean. So you would not have to wait to shower.One thing I would recommend is to bring a laptop or tablet as they do not have a tv in the room. For me that was one thing I didn’t really like. There were few days it rained and we had to stay in and there was nothing to do. It’s a good hotel if you want to simply lay your head at night, but a TV would have been really helpful. The other tip is that there is carpet in the rooms and if you have allergies it may bother you. I would also recommend having some fresh fruit in the front lobby area in combination with the sweet candies. The water, coffee and tea was nice to have after a long day.",5-Feb-19,1    San Remo Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81360-Reviews-San_Remo_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
81,"San Remo is a nice old-charm boutique hotel. We stayed 3 nights here. The hotel has a nice old colonial vibe to it. It is located in a nice place, just few blocks (5-7 min walk) away from Fisherman's Wharf. Rooms were quite small and there was no AC. Our room particularly had no window as well, so we had to open the ventilators which made it very noisy from the people in the corridor. They have nice refreshments near the reception. Washrooms were common, which was a downer, but it was well advertised like that - so we were aware of what we were getting into.",3-Feb-19,1    San Remo Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81360-Reviews-San_Remo_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
82,"Celebrating a retirement, three of us stayed at the San Remo in October. It was like a throw back to college years. Built only months after the big earthquake in 1906, the hotel was quaint and small, but the location was exceptional. Staff were always friendly and helpful, even offering to help us schlep our big box of wine down to our ride to the airport. We appreciated the coffee and water and sweet treats near the reception desk. Although the rooms were tight, we found the beds comfy, the hotel clean, guests quiet and friendly, and there was plenty of conversation starters based on the framed posters, pictures and art work in the hallways. The shared bathrooms and showers were not a problem. Enjoyed the nice Italian restaurant on the ground floor.

86,"Think of a hotel from an old western movie and you'll get the drift of San Remo.Many guests, including us, left their door open in the evening. My wife said that's because it's like staying at someone's house.Built in 1906, the decor seems largely original. Electric lighting and power outlets have been added but no a/c, T.V., or elevators.3 blocks from the Embarcadero, you shouldn't expect cheap. Our price was higher than Google advertised and does not include $20/night parking garage. Our room (#1) has a full bed and a sink. Toilets, showers, and a tub are down the hall. That may be off-putting to some but it's easy to make an argument against a toilet in your bedroom. Being 1 floor above the street, we had to deal with outside noise but most rooms don't have windows to the outside.I was reluctant to stay here but I'm glad we did.

93,"I absolutely loved my four night stay at the San Remo Hotel. It is a strange building, built to house construction workers after the 1906 earthquake, which means that there are many small bedrooms leading off the corridor and its spurs, and some of those bedrooms have internal windows only (though natural light does come in from skylights to most). The showers and toilets are shared, though were immaculately clean. Therefore, this hotel will not be for everyone - it is certainly not a bland corporate hotel. However, I thought it was brilliant. Though the rooms are quite small (not as small as some reviewers would have you believe), they are individually themed and furnished with care, giving the place an 'old world' feel. The beds have blankets and quilts, rather than a standard issue duvet, meaning temperature control at night is easy. The corridors are lined with interesting things - posters for old movies, old photographs, maps, 1900s furniture, an old writing desk, a massage chair (free to use), and a host of house plants. There is free coffee, water and various hot drink materials with brownies or madeleines next to reception. The staff are extremely helpful and uniformly friendly. The very nature of the place means that it can be a little noisy - but earplugs are provided in each room, and these are the most comfortable earplugs I have come across. Certainly, with one earplug on the side I don't sleep on meant that my sleep was uninterrupted by noise. Top tip: if you are able to book a room with a window and a sink, do - but if those are all gone, I would stay in the San Remo anyway.",15-Oct-18,1    San Remo Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81360-Reviews-San_Remo_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html

Walls also must be quite thick as didn't hear any noise from other guests. Yes you have to share bathrooms but the toilets and showers were cleaned regularly and also quirky. Ask for a room with a window of you like natural light as some of the rooms are internal. They also provide free tea and coffee and a printer which are nice touches.Next door there is an Italian restaurant which appears linked to the hotel and this is in the same style.

97,"Everything was fine. It's an inexpensive hotel in a nice part of town that is suitable for people who only intend to be in their hotel to sleep and shower. The rooms are tiny and the bathrooms and showers are shared but private when you use them. Sinks for shaving, brushing your teeth and washing your hands are not private, however, and are in the middle of hallways so when you pop out of your hotel room, you may see things you'd rather not see. The paper towel dispenser sticks out pretty from the wall in the hallway and I clocked my shoulder on it pretty good; I'd say it is in a dangerous spot. Many doors are on angles; I slammed my finger on a door when casually closing a bathroom door because the hinge was on one wall but the latch was at an angle on another wall and I was not paying attention to that.Internet access was very good.When I booked an airport shuttle at the front desk, I intended to book the shuttle advertised in the hotel's binder in our room. I had to pay the front desk a deposit for the shuttle and pay the driver the rest. The lady at the front desk told me, though, that the shuttle service listed in the hotel book was no more, and they had another service they booked with, ""at the same price in the book."" Yet I was book for a $17 shuttle, rather than the $14 in the book. I was told that they just hadn't gotten around to updating the book. However, I suspect that they just didn't want to list the name of the new shuttle company in their book so no one could research it before booking at the front desk. It's American Airporter Shuttle and it has one of the worst ratings I've ever seen on TripAdvisor. Unfortunately I trusted the lady at the hotel desk. The shuttle was half and hour late, the van was rickety and I was lied to about pickup times by the shuttle service. I was half an hour late getting to the airport. The hotel gets a cut of this serve and in no way should they be recommending this shuttle company. If their being shady in one area, they're probably being shady in others.Caveat emptor.",23-Sep-18,1    San Remo Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d81360-Reviews-San_Remo_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html

It's characterful, like staying at an eccentric Aunt who hasn't modernized her appt but it's in the best part of town, spotlessly clean and you have great memories of the place. I suppose the question is can you cope with a bathroom down the hall and as a consequence gave to see the other residents in various stages of undress. Actually it's fine and adds to the experience. The location is why you stay here, about 5 minutes from fisherman's wharf. There are great eateries all around and a trader Joe's down the block.

There was a supermarket etc in the Northpoint shops. Would highly recommend this for a budget conscious traveller. Rooms were small very adequate, bed was very comfortable.

107,"5 stars for the price and location. The narrow corridors are nicely decorated, and the rooms aren't as small as many here suggest, with room to maneuver around the bed and space underneath or on the wardrobe for your cases. Having a sink in the room is a bonus, although that costs extra, and we rarely encountered full showers or toilets. If you did, you moved down the corridor to the other ones. It was good having free coffee throughout the day, although it didn't appear until around 7:45, which was later than we'd prefer. There are a couple of supermarkets within 2 or 3 blocks and quite a few cafes and restaurants nearby. Walking up to much busier Washington Square to eat out only takes 10 minutes or so.

110,"Lovely property full of charm and style. The ensuite room was characterful with period fixtures although a bit dimly lit due to all the dark furniture and fittings. Breakfast was a substantial help yourself affair and the 4pm wine and cheese serving was a nice touch. The neighbourhood seems to be safe area with no local bars or restaurants but a 15 minute walk will bring you to a decent choice of eateries and drinking holes. The property is a fair way from downtown San Fransisco but only a cheap 20 minute bus ride to the harbour and pier 39, and the Painted Ladies are 5 minutes away. All in all a good stay and worth a visit",3-Oct-18,2    Chateau Tivoli Bed & Breakfast,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d113918-Reviews-Chateau_Tivoli_Bed_Breakfast-San_Francisco_California.html
111,"This was our second hotel whilst on a two week trip to SF. I booked this based on reviews, location and the style. Upon arriving, we were met by David, who was an exceptional host for our relatively short stay. He helped us with our luggage, showed us around the beautiful hotel, and was incredibly patient in answering a million and one questions we had about the area, and places to go while in SF. We stayed in the Mark Twain suite, which was stunning. Almost large enough to get lost in, the rooms were beautifully decorated, and it felt like going back in time (while still having all the modern luxuries). We had no complaints at all here.During the week, a simple continental style breakfast is served, this includes fruit, cereals, cold meats and cheeses etc. This was more than enough for us, and it was a nice place to sit while chatting to other guests and sharing stories from the previous day. At the weekend, they offer a more substantial cooked breakfast. The location is fantastic, just a couple of blocks from Alamo Square. There's an easy bus service (no 5) to the downtown area too.We really had no complaints or issues at all, and if and when we return to SF, we will definitely come back again.Thank for for the memories!!",25-Sep-18,2    Chateau Tivoli Bed & Breakfast,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d113918-Reviews-Chateau_Tivoli_Bed_Breakfast-San_Francisco_California.html
112,"There cannot be a nicer place to stay in San Francisco. The house has an amazing history, which is well documented. The owners have recreated the musical artistic feel, with fine furniture and works of art. The bedrooms are themed (we had the Enrico Caruso room) and have excellent bathrooms and showers.Between 4 and 6pm, complimentary wine and cheese are provided in the lounge, giving visitors the chance to share experiences and create new friendships.Continental breakfast is more than adequate.David, the manager, and his colleagues, could not do more to make people welcome, also offering good advice re places nearby to eat and visit. The restaurant we chose from the list provided was first class.",4-Aug-18,2    Chateau Tivoli Bed & Breakfast,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d113918-Reviews-Chateau_Tivoli_Bed_Breakfast-San_Francisco_California.html
113,"This historic Victorian is beautifully decorated with the artifacts and photos from its years of entertaining theater performers famous in their time. It feels like they are still here with you :) The breakfast is outstanding, rooms are very comfortable. Most have private baths, but I made a last minute reservation and could only get one of the rooms on the upper floor with a shared bath. It turned out not to be a problem at all, since there is a bathroom on the main floor available to all guests. It is just a block from the Painted Ladies and Alamo Square Park and an easy walk to Japan town and also to several UCSF medical buildings. I will definitely stay here again on my next visit to San Francisco.",27-Jul-18,2    Chateau Tivoli Bed & Breakfast,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d113918-Reviews-Chateau_Tivoli_Bed_Breakfast-San_Francisco_California.html
114,"My friend had stayed here before and recommended that we reserve a suite for Sunday and Monday. She requested the Mark Twain Suite, but it was booked so we chose the Luisa Tetrazzini Suite named after the Italian coloratura soprano. Beautiful rooms and furnishings and a modern bathroom that included a double (two nozzles) shower. We enjoyed playing chess and snacking on the wine & cheese served in the parlor. Chatted with some interesting people from New Orleans and NYC at the continental breakfast served by Bridget Monday morning.",6-Jul-18,2    Chateau Tivoli Bed & Breakfast,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d113918-Reviews-Chateau_Tivoli_Bed_Breakfast-San_Francisco_California.html
115,"This hotel is one of the least expensive by SF standards and it is a little gem. The rooms downstairs are beautifully decorated and are like a haven from the crazy world outside, and it is crazy outside. There are only 9 rooms which makes it more personal. The staff do everything to try and help, providing coffee or just chatting about the area. All staff were friendly. The happy hour is just fantastic with wine, cheese and biscuits located in the lovely historic room downstairs. Breakfast is available and most people sit together at a big table. Sunday they offer a special breakfast with champagne. We had the room at the top so would not recommend for people with mobility issues as there is no lift. I believe there are rooms downstairs as well. Room was lovely bed a bit small and shared bathroom outside which is not an issue. It was a bit of our town near Alamo Sq but there is a vibrant area nearby and it is pretty easy to get into the city by catching the bus at the top of the block. I would actually stay here again because of the service and the comfort.

116,My husband and I recently spent several nights at Chateau Tivoli. The house is gorgeous and the rooms well appointed.

117,"This is a gorgeous Victorian near Alamo Square that just popped out on an Expedia search. It's an amazing looking, ornate house on Steiner Street just steps from the Painted Ladies and a short walk to the San Francisco City Hall/Asian Art Museum area. The nearest BART stop is Civic Center which is about a mile away, so could be considered a bit of a hike for some. We usually didn't find this to be a problem.We stayed in the Joaquin Miller room, which is one of the smaller rooms on the third floor. The bed in there was only a double or full so we were a bit cozy but it was otherwise very comfortable. Some rooms have a private bathroom but ours was shared, which was a (very) slight inconvenience, but also one we were aware up when we booked. The claw-foot tub is cool looking but takes a little maneuvering to not get water on the floor. We did some laundry in the bathtub and hung it up to dry in the room.During the week they provide a continental breakfast buffet (coffee/tea, assorted bread and jam, meat, and cheese). On the weekend they'll cook you a hot breakfast from 9-11, which was quite delicious. Once day was French toast with fresh fruit and the other was quiche and a salad. The option of champagne/orange juice/mimosas was also provided with the hot breakfast. They also provide wine and cheese in the parlor from 4-6 every day. We usually missed this since we were out but it was a welcome treat the day we arrived.I was unable to get a decent WiFi signal in my room to save my life (tried all 3 available networks), however my wife didn't have this problem and she was right next to me, so it may have been a problem with my computer that I was just too lazy to solve at the time.Overall, a really cool place and we'd love to stay here again, and maybe check out of the bigger rooms.",29-Mar-18,2    Chateau Tivoli Bed & Breakfast,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d113918-Reviews-Chateau_Tivoli_Bed_Breakfast-San_Francisco_California.html
118,"Actually we have stayed here - near Alamo Square and the Painted Lady Victorians - 4 or 5 times whilst visiting one of our children. Like a home away from home. Funky-exquisite decor; you can imagine the bohemian lifestyle once led by its ""real"" occupants. Totally private. No one bugs you. Afternoon wine and cheese is set out in the Victorian parlor. Oh and did I mention the tasty no-fuss breakfasts. Even after 4 visits we have much to learn about just this one beautiful SF landmark hotel.",16-Oct-17,2    Chateau Tivoli Bed & Breakfast,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d113918-Reviews-Chateau_Tivoli_Bed_Breakfast-San_Francisco_California.html

It's so beautifully restored to Victorian standards, it was like going back in time.We were warmly welcomed by Nicholas, who throughout our stay helped us on numerous occasions. Can't thank him enough for going over and above his duties. Great guy.Bridget and the other staff were always polite and helpful, just what you want when you're away from home.No bar here but at 16:00 - 18:00 they brought out wine, cheese and biscuits. After a long and tiring day touring SF it was lovely just to relax and meet other guests, have a chat and find out the best places to visit - it was a lovely touch.5 Minutes walk from the 'Painted Ladies' and easy access to local buses but Nicholas put an app on my phone for a cab company called Lyft who were very efficient and reasonably priced.Highly recommend this lovely little 'Painted lady'.",4-Oct-17,2    Chateau Tivoli Bed & Breakfast,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d113918-Reviews-Chateau_Tivoli_Bed_Breakfast-San_Francisco_California.html
120,End of a three week trip splurge. It was worth it. We took tge bourgeois Tetrazini suite for three days and it was great. Bed was a little bendy in rhe middle but everything else was fabulous. I loved the peace and quiet. No television. Breakfast was good. One of the mornings there was fresh baked quiche which was awesome. Coffee was nice and really helpful staff.

122,"We stayed in the two basement suites - Lola Montez and Lily Langtry. The suites were beautifully decorated, clean and very spacious. The building itself is amazing and if you are looking for a boutique hotel that is also quirky and in an excellent location then look no further. Close to excellent bus links and within easy walking distance of many local attractions it is a bonus to be outside of the busy Union Square district. The hosts were welcoming, very helpful and generous with their time and gave us plenty of information. Staying at the Chateau was like having the luxury of a hotel but also the freedom of being in your own home - being able to sit in the parlour and read, have a glass of wine or even order a takeaway! We loved it, we were all so sad to leave and say goodbye to such an incredible painted lady.",23-Mar-17,2    Chateau Tivoli Bed & Breakfast,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d113918-Reviews-Chateau_Tivoli_Bed_Breakfast-San_Francisco_California.html

It was quiet and perfect for the three adults visiting the city for five nights. The hosts couldn't have been nicer and were very helpful with restaurant suggestions and transportation (very easy walk to public transportation). The breakfasts were excellent, as was the wine and cheese reception each evening. In an expensive city like San Francisco, it the Chateau Tivoli is an exceptional value as well.

124,"I've been staying at the Chateau Tivoli for 12 years. As a music and movie lover I find it perfectly situated to easily get to multiple venues and theaters. With no two night minimum like many BnBs I generally come in just for the night of a show. It's just blocks from the Independent and the historic Fillmore auditorium. A quick bus or taxi ride gets you to the Opera, the Rickshaw Stop, the Regency or Warfield. Really, this neighborhood couldn't be more centrally located. Staying at the Tivoli and strolling to Divisadero street or Hayes valley feels like staying in a lively European town. There's an abundance of excellent restaurants on Divisadero street and there seems to be several new ones every time I visit. During my last visit around the holidays I found an excellent new greek place and a new ice cream shop!I've stayed in many of the rooms at the Tivoli and find that they each have a unique and distinct charm. I splurged on the Mark Twain Suite once and have to say that would be my favorite but I most often prefer to stay in the Isadora Duncan room. Even though the bathroom is across the hall, it is private and huge! It has what looks to be the original tile and a claw foot tub. The room itself is very comfortable and although it's right off the street it is very quiet and peaceful. I've taken the most excellent daytime naps in there.The Innkeepers are not just nice but extremely helpful, some of their tips have saved me quite a bit of grief when trying to navigate San Francisco. As familiar as I am with SF I have found when you're unaware of events or conferences you can find yourself unpleasantly surprised in a city that likes to keep things interesting. The breakfasts here are very well thought out, the term 'continental' is misleading for their weekday breakfasts since they put out such a large variety of items you won't feel anything lacking. The weekend brunches have always been excellent even though I rarely stick around for them. The smell of french toast as I check out always lifts my spirits. Looking forward to my next visit in April",14-Jan-17,2    Chateau Tivoli Bed & Breakfast,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d113918-Reviews-Chateau_Tivoli_Bed_Breakfast-San_Francisco_California.html

We had a very warm welcome arriving early - we left our luggage and on our return it had been taken up to our room. The afternoon wine and cheese was really nice - we managed to chat with some or the other guests which was enjoyable. The breakfast was great - again you sit at s long table so can chat with fellow guests if you choose!! Good choice of food, including homemade quiche which was interesting for breakfast!!

What it lacked however, was adequate natural lighting. the smaller bedroom is dark despite their lights, the main bedroom is okay. It did get cold for us one night, we had to pull the comforter off the other bed. The folks running the place, esp Nicholas, were very friendly and helpful. Good advice and instructions the day we arrived, can't thank him enough for that- saved us some money for sure!! He has done well to maintain the 'antiqueness' of the place.

137,"We stayed for 4 night, 2 of them were in the Joaquin Miller room with the shared bathroom and 2 in Enrique Caruso with a private bathroom. If you are going to book a shared bathroom room, I suggest booking the one we stayed in, the other one (I think called Jack London) is right next to the toilet, so we walked past their room every time we needed the bathroom. It's an old house, you can hear everything. I preferred our first room to our second as it was cosier. I think that a big improvement they could make is to the breakfast offering, it's just quite poor compared to other places we have stayed at. There is lots of sugary cereal, toast, sweet breads, sweet yoghurt and even the ham was sweet probably from a glaze. Ok, so it's not to our tastes but even so having a huge hit of sugar to start the day is not good for anyone. There is some fruit but not enough. I suggest having a large fruit bowl, some boiled eggs, some healthier cereal and that would vastly improve things. I actually bought my own cereal from Whole Foods and only ate that in the end. Cheese and wine is served between 4-6pm which is great. The house has great character, it was a very cosy stay and the staff were very helpful.

Nicholas and Meredith were lovely and made sure our stay was a pleasant one. We loved returning to the Chateau after a busy day and enjoying happy hour. This was daily from 4-6pm. A selection of wines and cheeses were on offer, a perfect way to relax and chat with other guests.

144,"We stayed for 4 nights in the Jack London room. Lovely clean room, with a table and chairs set in the turret... yes the turret! Wi-Fi was no problem in the room, able to stream videos. If you want to watch anything you'll have to do it via the internet as there is no TV. The breakfast was really good, continental during the week and a champagne breakfast with cooked bacon and eggs at the weekend.

146,"The place is beautiful inside and out.We stayed in the Jack London room on the 3rd floor - long climb, but worth it. Nonetheless, we're likely to to stay in a second floor room the next time - the stairs to the 3rd floor are steep! The weekday breakfasts are nice - continental but not just a pastry and some coffee. They provide cream cheese, excellent jams, yogurt, and granola. The weekend champagne brunch is more elaborate - french toast, bacon, and fresh fruit. Not to mention the champagne.The afternoon wine & cheese is nice, although not as social as some I've seen at B&Bs - that is a question of the clientele, not the staff as far as I can see.Big disadvantage here is parking - it's all street and will be requiring a visitor permit at some point later in 2015. We didn't mind, we're used to street parking in Baltimore. Also, the inn is located close to several major public transit arteries, so a car may not be necessary.There is free wi-fi, but it may not reach all rooms.",13-Jun-15,2    Chateau Tivoli Bed & Breakfast,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d113918-Reviews-Chateau_Tivoli_Bed_Breakfast-San_Francisco_California.html

The Inn keeper (Meredith) and Inn Manager (Nicholas) were fantastic. The breakfast was awesome. Later in the afternoon wine and cheese are available. Delicious and a great presentation. One of the quest played the lobby piano while we relaxed upstairs in our room. It was amazing. We highly recommend this B&B. We will return in the future.

It is elegant, well decorated, superb service, really great location just a block from the painted ladies, filled with charm, history and character. Don't think I'll ever stay at another hotel when I'm in San Francisco. Reasonable room rates. One negative that does go along with the territory: offstreet parking is all they have.

151,"Basically, if they've availability, book it. We stayed just two nights and wished we could have stayed longer. We stayed in the Isadora Duncan room which had it's own private bathroom across the corridor. Which almost put us off making the booking but in fact it was more than fine, the bathroom was huge and very tastefully decorated. It was literally three steps from our room.The room was on the first floor and overlooked Steiner Street. The bed was comfortable and huge. All the furnishings were very high quality and sympathetic to this historical mansion. The room had very tall ceilings and had some lovely artwork. The rooms have no minibar or television in keeping with the style of the accommodation.The parlour, where cheese and wine were served every afternoon was a delight, with comfortable period furniture, a piano, interesting ornamentation and a vintage valve radio playing classical music. The parlour leads onto the dining room where breakfast was served at a communal table and also at a table for two. It's a continental breakfast and is very good. You can also use the kitchen which is out back behind the dining room. If you want to cook or keep things cold in the fridge.Staying in an historical mansion was a unique experience for us and was one of the highlights of our holiday.Parking is quite hard to come by if you arrive in the afternoon, we had to park three blocks away. However it's free. Also, we we warned by a member of staff not to walk through a nearby block close by. Think it was Filmore Street. That freaked us out a bit. We felt safe in the immediate neighbourhood though and used public transport without any bother.Chateau Tivoli is not central, but their is a bus stop nearby and the Haight neighbourhood was in walking distance. We walked back one afternoon from the city centre and it was a leisurely one hour stroll.All in all we had a fantastic experience.",8-Nov-14,2    Chateau Tivoli Bed & Breakfast,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d113918-Reviews-Chateau_Tivoli_Bed_Breakfast-San_Francisco_California.html

153,Our second visit and it was lovely to be welcomed back like old friends. It was good to see Nico & Meredith again and they couldn't have been more helpful - we could only stay one night on this trip but they let us drop our luggage off early the day we arrived and kept it for us until late afternoon the day we left. Meredith also arranged a very reasonably priced limo transfer to the airport for us.

155,"We spent 5 days in the Lily Langtree suite and could not have found a more delightful place to stay in San Francisco.The Chateau is beautiful, quirky, classy and full of character. The decor is fits the era and the whole feel is calm and dignified.Our suite was advertised as being ""in the basement"", but with the hilly nature of the area, we had windows at street level and our own private door onto the street.Even though the word ""suite"" was used when we booked, we expected, for the reasonable price we paid, to get a room and possibly a hallway, but we ended up with two bedrooms and two hallways !The continental breakfasts were great and there was complimentary cheese and wine laid out in the reception rooms every afternoon - with the antique radiogram tuned to the classical station. We did not stay long enough to sample the weekend champagne breakfasts, sadly.The B&B is near Alamo Square and the (now dull pastel) Painted Ladies. The #5 bus passes by regularly a half a block away and goes to town (Market Street) one way and the Botanical Gardens and Ocean View beach the other way. Fillmore and its restuarants and jazz is a short walk down the hill and Divisadero street with its shops and coffee bars is a walk of several quite steep blocks the other way.The Chateau has free wi-fi, though the signal is only strong in the reception rooms. We could get a signal from our toilet ! But there are plenty of chairs, tables and settees to settle into in the sitting room upstairs - with a glass of good wine if you choose your time right.On top of all this - the staff were wonderful. Friendly, helpful, chatty, kind, full of suggestions.... They made the stay that much more special. Thank you Meredith and Nick.Beware. There are no TV's in the B&B. There suggestion is that if you need to be entertained, they have board games and plenty of books to read. Somehow this made things even more specially and classy and got us out and about more than we might have done normally.Top tip for San Francisco if you don't have a car: Buy a visitor pass for the Muni transport.You pay $3 for a Clipper card and then load it with either a 1-day, 3-day or 7-day pass. This means you can travel on all the buses, trams and trolleys, whenever you like. It does not cover the BART (underground) however, but we never found the need to use this anyway.",14-Aug-14,2    Chateau Tivoli Bed & Breakfast,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d113918-Reviews-Chateau_Tivoli_Bed_Breakfast-San_Francisco_California.html
156,"My family and I stayed for 3 nights at this delightful B&B. It's very quirky and charming. The rooms are lovely (and no TV - how fantastic. You don't go on holiday to watch TV anyway.) I normally sleep very badly in hotels, but our bed was extremely comfortable. The B&B is a bit outside of the centre of SF, but once you have got the hang of public transport it isn't a problem. And frankly staying in the centre of the city is very noisy. Breakfast was fantastic, as was the cheese and wine every afternoon. Overall a great visit. I thoroughly recommend the Chateau Tivoli.",4-Aug-14,2    Chateau Tivoli Bed & Breakfast,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d113918-Reviews-Chateau_Tivoli_Bed_Breakfast-San_Francisco_California.html

158,"Stayed here late October 2013. We were in the Jack London room. Very tidy and the turret was super cute! Only problem I found with room was lack of power sockets near bed, but I guess that comes with and older building. Sharing the bathroom with the room next door was never an issue, and if we were desperate there was a bathroom available on the main level. The bathroom was nice and there was plenty of shampoo, conditioner, soap, etc. Bathtub has a handheld shower head but I found I was too tall and had to kneel in the bath to wash my hair! Third floor staircase is skinny and it was a little hard dragging our luggage up there.Staff were so friendly and helpful. Were happy to hold our luggage for us when we checked out and let us wait in lounge area in evening as we had a very late flight. Dressed up for Halloween too which was cool! The breakfast was delicious and there was quite a lot to choose from. Good location, five minutes from Alamo Square. We would walk down to Pier 39 etc in morning and then taxi home in the evening after our day for a reasonable price. Overall I loved it here. I've stayed in a LOT of hotels in the USA and this is my favourite. The building is absolutely gorgeous and it was like being transported back to a different era.

159,"Chateau Tivoli is a boutique hotel / guesthouse in San Francisco. The building, its interior, its decoration scream original period detail. The hotel has modern creature comforts such as wifi and en-suite bathrooms, but other than that you feel blissfully transported back to another era.It is a period building, so there is no double glazing and no air conditioning (i.e. expect some noise from the street, but not enough to disturb your sleep).Breakfast is served at a large shared dining table, with only one table for two in the window bay. Therefore you need to be able to put on a ""morning face"" and chat with your fellow guests over breakfast (this will either be your heaven or your hell, depending on your personal taste). The breakfast menu is simple but delicious. Expect bucks fizz with breakfast on Sunday mornings.Complimentary cheese and wine are served mid-afternoon, and the selection is generous.The staff are helpful and friendly, but discrete and not in your face.We enjoyed our stay here, and would happily stay there again.

160,"We only needed a place to stay for one night and are glad we came across this reasonably-priced Bed and Breakfast. As we had just come into town very early in the morning after a cruise, we were happy that Meredith of the Chateau welcomed us in the morning and allowed us to keep our luggage there while we explored the city for the day.She even offered us breakfast which was very nice - lots of selections for everyone's breakfast desires. There were two types of cereals, yogurt, bagels, bread slices, quiche, fresh fruit salads, smoked salmon with capers and onions, etc. Coffee, tea, juice and water also available.We stayed in the basement suite which consisted of a little kitchen, two bedrooms and a bathroom. The heritage of this large home is incredibly well-kept - I wish we could have stayed longer to get a good look at the whole place. The main floor has a large sitting areaAlthough this place is not that close to town, it is very easy to get there by bus or bicycle.

161,"Because our youngest son was with us for two of our three night stay at Chateau Tivoli, we chose the Lola Montez ""basement economy suite."" It was a superb choice: The suite was spacious, comfortable, and quite affordable. Because of its private entrance, the basement suite was well-suited for our bicycles, our primary means of travel while in ""The Cool Gray City of Love."" My sole criticism of the ""basement economy suite"" is that the lovely original woodwork could use a fresh coat of paint!Meredith, the innkeeper, is the very model of professionalism, competence, and friendliness. She also prepares and serves outstanding breakfasts (the recent review complaining about the quality of the weekday breakfast leaves me baffled!).Chateau Tivoli's location was ideal for our two-wheeled exploration of the remarkable neighborhoods and architecture in what is surely one of the two or three most iconic of all American cities--a place quite easy ""to leave your heart in"" and one to which we hope to return again in the near future.",30-Apr-14,2    Chateau Tivoli Bed & Breakfast,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d113918-Reviews-Chateau_Tivoli_Bed_Breakfast-San_Francisco_California.html

The closet was ample and there is a room safe which we used (very convenient). We were facing Lombard St. As other reviewers have discussed, it was noisy. And, another reviewer was correct that there are rooms facing off the main drag but with an additional fee of $10. I think you have to put this in perspective. Hotels sometimes charge more for a pool view or an ocean view or how high up your room is. This is no different. And, I feel badly that someone smeared the staff. They were great! If you want more quiet, pay the $10. The room is already a bargain by SF standards and a good one at that. If not, bring your eye mask and ear plugs and turn your phone on white noise and I bet you would be ok.

182,"Beware of the bait and switch! On our first visit to the Cow Hollow Inn we were given a room was facing Lombard Street. For those who are not familiar with San Francisco, Lombard aka U.S. 101 which goes through town and over the Golden Gate Bridge and is one of the busier thoroughfares in the city. If your room is on Lombard you will hear a pretty constant stream of car and truck traffic. The hotel is nothing fancy, but more expensive than a similar two star hotel in other cities. Remember it is San Francisco! Our kids live a few blocks from the hotel so it is convenient. On our second visit to the cow Hollow Inn, I noticed a couple of things on the website when I was making my reservation. They offer, Standard, Deluxe and Superior rooms with relative increasing rates. Typically this means bigger rooms, maybe a sofa etc. Links to the room descriptions were broken. I got that 404 error message. I was content with the standard room price. They also had a drop down list of requests. For example you could ask for a room on the 1st, Floor, 2nd Floor, 3rd Floor, ""Back Room If Possible"", Crib, Early Arrival, Extra Pillow, Foam Pillow… etc. Oh yea refrigerator $5.00 per day. I thought that was nice so I requested a back room and foam pillow.On the day before we were to arrive I received a call from the hotel confirming my reservation, acknowledging that I had requested a back room. They mentioned that I had selected a standard room and that the back rooms are deluxe or better so if I wanted a back room away from Lombard, it would be $10 more per day.I told them I was confused because the website did not indicate a surcharge for a back room request, nor a surcharge for any other request except if I wanted a refrigerator. I told them that I found their request offensive and that it seemed like a shake down for more money. I ask them to grant my request for a back room (they already indicated it was possible) and that I should not be charged. They said that they could not honor this request, but they would pass on my concern to the owners. When I checked in the next day we were located in a room facing Lombard and no foam pillow. I am one of those foolish people that does not like to complain all the time on small issues so I did not. At the same respect I do not like to take be taken advantage of either.. The hotel was clean, but had an antiseptic smell in the halls…sort of like a hospital. The house keeping staff was efficient and the room was cleaned promptly, though low grade shampoo and conditioner.It is not much money, but probably an indication of the owners mindset. I am choosing to vote with my dollars and will be selecting another hotel for our next visit to the kids.If you must stay at the Cow Hollow Inn, beware of the noise on Lombard and the sneaky front desk staff looking to up-charge you for a simple request.

183,"Very nice rooms and friendly staff, but they gave us a room facing Lombard street and found very noisy due to traffic.The underground parking was a nice feature and rooms very clean and spacious, also close to wharf and other amenities.

185,"We (2 couples) stayed at the Cow Hollow Inn & Suites for 3 nights at the start of our California Adventure. We booked a 2 Bedroom/2 Bathroom Suite, complete with Full Living Room, Dining Table and Kitchen. We stayed in the 3rd Floor of the Blair Building and could not have been happier with our choice.Clean and comfortable Suite, with plenty of room for the four of us. Free covered parking, with easy elevator access, included in the rate. And, the location was terrific!Plenty of Restaurants, Bars and Shopping within the surrounding blocks. Easy to get to the Fisherman's Wharf area, as well as other sites we wanted to see.Finally, the reservation person (we booked directly with Cow Hollow) and Check-In Desk folks were friendly and helpful.Just remember, San Francisco is an expensive hotel market. Cow Hollow Inn & Suites, while not low budget, was very fairly priced. You can't go wrong with this property.Only two suggestions: Main A/C Unit is in Living Room, so the two Bedrooms could use Fans; and,don't go to Mel's Diner (across the street) it's terrible.",12-Feb-19,3    Cow Hollow Inn and Suites,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d112293-Reviews-Cow_Hollow_Inn_and_Suites-San_Francisco_California.html
186,"My husband and I have been staying at this hotel a lot over the last five years. Medical needs have made it necessary to stay two or three days at least every three months. I have ALS and can no longer speak and it is difficult to walk. Because of that I always ask for a certain room close to the elevator. This time when we checked in we were given a different room. I wrote a note to the person helping me and was then scolded for thinking that we could always have that room. We accepted a different room and upon checking in thought it was fine. I unpacked our clothes and set up the equipment for a feeding tube. Finally put on my robe and I had stockings on. It was then that we realized that the carpet was wet! My socks were soaked! I wrote an email expressing our dismay with the situation. This was at 3:30. No response at all. The next morning I see where this woman responded at 11:00 last night. Again, spent most of her time scolding over the room number although in my note, I said the room was fine, it was the wet carpet that was the problem. We had a choice...we could get a king bed on a noisy street or two double beds. Nothing whatsoever to apologize for our wet floor! We will not stay here again. The woman, Irene, could have cared less that I am handicapped and could not speak to explain our issues.

188,"We’ve stayed here a few times before, great location and clean place to stay. We usually ask for a room off Lombard, but this visit for some reason the outside noise was more noticeable this time, it sounded like our room was just above a bar. Unfortunately this time we left behind a bag of items, containing about $100 worth of items. It was a gift given to us by a family friend and we inadvertently left it sitting on the dresser. We realized the next morning as we were unpacking we had left the bag at the hotel. I called the hotel and the hotel receptionist said the items were not turned in by hotel staff and she said they were more than likely thrown out. The hotel receptionist said she would contact the staff member who had cleaned our room that day and get back to us. We never heard back. It’s hard to believe our bag of items had been thrown out as the times were all unopened. Sad to think we would have been better off leaving the bag in our car in the hotel garage! I know it’s our fault for leaving the bag but unfortunate staff just discards items left behind.",31-Dec-18,3    Cow Hollow Inn and Suites,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d112293-Reviews-Cow_Hollow_Inn_and_Suites-San_Francisco_California.html
189,"The positives for this hotel are the free underground parking as parking in San Fran is very difficult and can be expensive. We parked our car up here and then used UBER's to get around which were very efficient. Also, the cafe downstairs (not related) called Home Plate is a perfect place to get breakfast. However the staff were not very friendly, in fact they were quite rude and dismissive on our arrival, and the room was quite old fashioned and needed some updating, hence the three stars.

194,"We arrived in SF on 4 October 2018; being the final part of our trip having previously visited Vegas and San Diego. We took the Bart from the airport (the machines to buy the tickets are very confusing and looked to be set up so ou would overpay) to embarcadero as recommended on this very site and got a taxi to the hotel after eventually finding the right entrance from the station. Overall cost was $35 for the two of us. The room wasn't ready until 4 o clock but we could leave our bags in a secure room. We were in room 333 which as requested on booking directly was on the top floor at the back of the hotel. The room was lovely, very comfortable, had a view of golden gate bridge and had a coffee machine. The hotel is in a fantastic position with lots of bars and restaurants on chestnut st or union st. We had breakfast at Noahs' bagels which was really good and highly recommended. Fisherman's wharf is in walking distance though we generally used the number 30 bus which goes there and then onto union square (We got a weekly pass for $37 which was an absolute bargain as you can also use it on the cable cars which are $7a trip alone). Only thing to watch out with the number 30 bus is that the 30x doesn't go to union square and the 30s on the way back only goes as far as van Ness. The hotel offered a shuttle to the airport for $17 each but this picks up at other hotels and we were told to allow two hours for the journey so got an uber ($55) instead. Would definitely stay at this hotel if we ever returned to the best city we have ever been to in the USA.",28-Oct-18,3    Cow Hollow Inn and Suites,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d112293-Reviews-Cow_Hollow_Inn_and_Suites-San_Francisco_California.html

197,"There are a lot of places to stay in San Francisco, many of them scorchingly expensive, particularly when a big convention is in town. Then there are out-of-the way places that are, in fact, really good, both in quality and location. Cow Hollow Inn and Suites is one of them. Actually it's in a very lively part of the city - near Union Street and Chestnut Street, both destinations for locals search for life and food. It's also a short walk from Fort Mason. Lombard Street leads straight to the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, so it gets a lot of traffic. We stayed here because we didn't want to pay $1000 per night in the middle of town during a major convention. It was a great decision. Cow Hollow is very comfortable and has great staff. If you have a car (we didn't) it also as terrific parking. Lots of restaurants nearby and the city itself is just an Uber away. If you like quiet, it is best to pay a bit extra for an inside room. We did and slept like logs. Silence is wonderful. Check out Mel's diner across the street for breakfast.

198,"I booked online at Booking.com, and immediately after realized I didn't actually need the room, as friends were able to put us up. I called right away and asked if they could please make an exception to their online booking no-cancellation policy, as I had made a mistake. The desk receptionist said I would have to wait for the manager, who wouldn't be back until the next day. The manager was adamant that she would not make an exception, insisting that I could only change the date and not cancel. I explained that I wouldn't need the room on any other date because we were moving to the area. She said that was all she was willing to do, as there was a no cancellation policy. No cancellation policies exist so there won't be last-minute cancellations where you can't fill the room - I called immediately, so this is just her insisting on keeping the $300 for a booking I couldn't even keep. So we kept the room, even though we didn't need it, and since we were both laid up with the flu, we stayed with our friends instead of checking into the hotel that night. I just checked my credit card statement and there's an inexplicable $8.00 charge from this hotel. For what? Why? Why would they do that? It's not the amount of money that matters but they already HAD $300 I could ill afford and now they charge me $8 for no reason at all? We weren't even THERE, what could we possibly have done to merit a charge? I called to ask what the charge was for and the receptionist said he didn't know, he'd have to ask the manager. OH GOOD can't wait to deal with that penny-pinching jerk again, can't wait to hear why she charged me $8 in addition to the $300 I paid for a room she probably went ahead and rented to someone else so she could double her money. Their hold music, by the way, promises a ""friendly and accommodating"" staff. They've been anything but friendly and accommodating. They've been useless without this manager and the manager has been a straight-up epithet. I don't know what the rooms are like and I don't care - the management is a piece of work.",26-Sep-18,3    Cow Hollow Inn and Suites,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d112293-Reviews-Cow_Hollow_Inn_and_Suites-San_Francisco_California.html

He then stored our language and gave us several maps and tips to explore the City. In general a very nice person.Returning in the afternoon, LYN were then in the reception.

You could walk into Fishermans Wharf/Union Square without problem or Uber was also very reasonable price. Rooms were a great size too for San Francisco and the free parking was a major bonus. On the downside was the road noise, if you are staying in a room that is on Lombard Street then ear plugs are a must, it did quieten down at night but still wasn't great and the traffic started again very early, better glazing is needed. I only really dealt with one member of staff during our stay and afraid to say that the level of customer service was not great, didn't seem interested or helpful with the few issues we had.",4-Sep-18,3    Cow Hollow Inn and Suites,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d112293-Reviews-Cow_Hollow_Inn_and_Suites-San_Francisco_California.html

Our overarching goal was to find a hotel which was centralized between our scheduled activities and our oldest son's home. We found the Cow Hollow Inn and Suites to be in the perfect location.We found the hotel staff to be extremely professional and courteous during our stay. The manager's recommendations for breakfast and lunch were outstanding and greatly appreciated. We used the rental car very little and having the garage made for a safe parking location.The hotel may be a bit outdated but it was very comfortable and the room was spacious. We visited the Blue Barn, Home Plate and Pete's Coffee & Tea which were each fantastic and literally only steps away. Plenty of high end shopping one block away which was very much enjoyed by certain members of the family. NOTE: This is an expensive trip so plan accordingly!Pack your sneakers! The best way to see the sights are on foot if you are able to do so - we walked to Crissy Field multiple times per day, to the base of the Golden Gate Bridge and to Fisherman's Wharf.

It reminds me a bit of a British sit-com, yes the hotel is a teeny fusty in style, but as a solo female traveler, i appreciated its cozy comforts with its close hallways and rooms. Lots of nice service when I checked in, but then they leave you alone. I am not the sort who loves talking to strangers over breakfast, so their parlor style, with a variety of table shapes and sizes suited me. The resident cat Pip charmed me each morning as he sat in a chair and stared my coffee and me. My ONLY quibble with this hotel was the 8 am start time for breakfast, which is a bit late for some of us reluctant early risers. But the coffee, croissants and juice were worth the wait.

218,"Stayed here for a third time simply because we love the location and the people. We started our trip with 4 nights here and returned for our final night. Comfortable, clean and quiet for a good nights sleep. Whether it is Dora at breakfast, Spencer at check in or Halim thereafter, all 3 are a credit to this place. Particularly enjoyed our chat with Halim, he is a gem with 37 years at this place.",19-May-19,4    Golden Gate Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d74052-Reviews-Golden_Gate_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
219,We recently stayed for 1 night in this very welcoming hotel in San Francisco. They really go the extra mile to make you feel welcome. they provide tea and biscuits at 4 pm for guests - you can sit in the parlour and meet other guests. The breakfast is very nice and you can share tables with other guests. Most rooms have a bathroom but ours did not - which I knew when I booked. The shared facility was just a few steps from our door. Each room has its own sink. We arrived early and were able to check in early - great after a long flight. We will definitely stay there again.,11-May-19,4    Golden Gate Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d74052-Reviews-Golden_Gate_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
220,"I have stayed here 8 times in the past 9 years. I much prefer the cozy rooms and friendly atmosphere to a hotel chain.

221,I had a semi-business/pleasure trip planned for San Francisco. Golden Gate Hotel was the best location for both. The light rail (BART) has direct connections from San Francisco Airport. It dropped me and my wheeled suitcase at Powell and Market and a slow walk up hill had me arriving at the hotel in good time.For the solo or group traveler there are several nearby restaurants to either get food to go or to sit and eat. The Asian Museum was only a 10-15 minute walk. Grace Cathedral is just 3 blocks away. (Very steep but doable if you're patient enough to walk slowly.) In addition to religious services there are concerts on Sundays.China town is several short blocks down hill.A continental breakfast of tea and coffee along with a basket of baked goods and OJ are served each morning. Tea and cookies are served at 4 PM. I have been here before and always have an opportunity to chat with fellow travelers from all over the world.,18-Apr-19,4    Golden Gate Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d74052-Reviews-Golden_Gate_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
222,"The Golden Gate Hotel was just like a perfect English B&B in both service and decor. From 'tea and cookies in the parlour' at 4pm to the ancient lift and proper tea in a pot with huge croissants and muffins for breakfast you cannot fault it. Comfy bed, very clean, great service and Pip the cat who entertained us with his antics of cajoling - and often bullying - staff to give him treats. A great 3 night stay. We had a room with a shower, sink and a shared toilet which we coped with very well. Perfect location for walking out to Union Square, China town, The Cable Car Museum and Fisherman's Wharf - all of which we did. Nice restaurants nearby too - try Bouche and Cafe de la Press.

This charming little hotel is located near Chinatown in a great location for walking for those riding public transportation. We also had a rental car with us, even though we didn't use it around the city, and the hotel offers a discount at the parking garage directly across the street for $30/day, which is a great find in the city if you must park. The hotel has an vintage feel with the antique elevator and furnishings, but our room was very clean. It was actually the best bed I slept in on our 10 day trip around California. The breakfast was good in the morning - croissants, coffee, etc. We never took advantage of the afternoon tea, but we were told it was available. All the staff was accommodating and pleasant as well.

231,"The Golden Gate Hotel it's a small Hotel with minimalist features, an almost non-existent lobby, and a very small dining area that seats about 12 people comfortably. That being said , it reminds me of some of the smaller hotels I've stayed in places like Paris and the outskirts of Rome. If you are looking for a Westin or a Hilton this is not the place. If you're looking for a place with some character and charm at a reasonable price then this is the place.On the inside it's clearly a B&B Style Hotel comma the rooms are a little bit dated but not didn't you or dirty .. more like something you would find in the berkshires of Massachusetts then the tourist district of San Francisco .. especially the cat that has free roam of the lobby area and stairs and hallways and the owners quartersYou should make sure to review their website carefully, there are some rooms with shared bathrooms so if that's not your thing make sure to read the details of your reservation. The breakfast is minimal but adequate to get your day started and the people are so pleasant. If you want a full breakfast there are plenty of places nearby at very reasonable prices. I know this might not sound like the greatest review but finding a location like this in San Francisco is really quite a find if you're open to a place that feels like you're staying at your grandparents house comma I know I will be back again.",10-Oct-18,4    Golden Gate Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d74052-Reviews-Golden_Gate_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html

The woman who owns this place is an elderly German woman who I have heard puts out a lovely breakfast. The room was very clean with charm that i wish you could fist everywhere but you just can't. It has a very old fashioned elevator that I have had the opportunity to ride one other time in my life. A claw foot bathtub which I hadn't used since I was a child.

Location is great - just 1 block to cable car and tons of options for eating in the area. I think the price was very reasonable for the area and they do have a parking option right across the street that was easy. My only complaint was that the woman that checked us in was new and seemingly flustered by 3 rooms I had booked for the group.

Yes you have to share bathrooms but it wasn't a problem and the big fluffy robes are lovely. The place is spotless and staff were so friendly.

Spencer told us where to eat and was very helpful. He packed us a go bag of croissants before our early flight so we got fed even on our last day.

The hallways have trompe-l'oeuil paintings, frames with old views of San Francisco, cozy-looking desk lamps in the corners, and soft carpets. Riding the the old-fashioned elevator, just opening and closing its double metal gates, was fun. Even the walls of the elevator shafts were painted and made for an enjoyable ride. Breakfast was served by the owners in a small and cozy room by the reception. Some of the tables are for sharing which makes it easy to strike up conversations with other guests. The entrance area was presided over by a dignified-looking cat whose preferred resting place seemed to be the New York Times paper on the desk. He looked like the real owner of the place, with his likeness etched into the glass-door hotel entrance, printed on the bathroom soap wrappers and even the shampoo labels. His presence, the antique decoration and the friendly owners made us feel very much at home.

It is not for people who want everything big and modern, but it has what we needed. We booked a room with two twin beds and a private bath. The bath included a large clawfoot tub, and this was a major plus for me in a city that invites and requires a lot of walking. There are lots of antique touches, including an amazing cage elevator and something I've never seen before: a toilet with a round tank. There's lots of interesting art throughout the hotel as well. The armoire had a generous number of hangers and the room included two chairs, a couple of tables and a dresser. I was worried that the street-facing room on the third floor would be noisy, and there is definitely traffic noise. But the windows shut out a lot of it, and it quiets down after nine more than I would have expected so close to restaurants and bars, even on Friday and Saturday. I didn't need the earplugs I brought. The staff are friendly and professional and the owners are charming and helpful. Pip the cat is delightful as well. The breakfast is fine; they were able to accommodate us with some gluten free toast. They offer a discount for parking in the garage across the way and it is much less than you will pay anywhere else. There are also two car rental agencies in that garage. We rented a car just for our last day to travel out of the city, and then dropped it off at the airport. You really can't be the price for the location.",29-Mar-17,4    Golden Gate Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d74052-Reviews-Golden_Gate_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
259,"Changed hotels at the last minute to Golden Gate and glad I did. It is located right up from Union Square and Chinatown and right on the cable car line. The building is a bit older and has an ancient, but working elevator. Room was clean and comfortable, but smaller than you would find in a chain hotel. the hosts are great and try to help however they can. Location is right in the middle of a ton of great restaurants.",11-Mar-17,4    Golden Gate Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d74052-Reviews-Golden_Gate_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
260,"I spent one night at the Golden Gate Hotel on a business trip. Pros: great staff that bend over backward to meet needs; clean and cozy room; nicely decorated; friendly cat; easy walk to many great restaurants and shopping; near cable car line. Cons: room too small for business work; unable to connect with printer; breakfast too late for my need to be at a business by 8 am; hearing people talk in room next door to late in the night; expensive parking across the street (but not too bad for SF). Overall, I would stay here again if I was with my husband on a leisurely trip.

261,"Stayed here as it was reasonably priced, and found room to be clean, though small. Location convenient. Stayed during fall, so temperature was not an issue. Small functional elevator, but nice stairs makes use unnecessary.There was a pleasant welcome, afternoon tea and cookies were great. Unfortunately, as days started early, was unable to try and comment on breakfast.Yes there is a resident cat, and the one thing that was noticeable was the overpowering smell - possibly cat urine, every time you came and went. That is the only reason will likely consider elsewhere next time. Could be dramatically helped by a refreshing of the carpets.",3-Feb-17,4    Golden Gate Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d74052-Reviews-Golden_Gate_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
262,"My husband and I needed emergency accommodations in SF, and we immediately thought of the Golden Gate Hotel, where we had stayed on a previous visit. They accommodated us with warmth and concern for our situation. We stayed the first three nights in a room with a shared bath, which proved to be just like staying at a friends house without a private bath. The room was charming and comfortable. We then moved into a room with a private bath, and it was comfortable and quiet. This place goes out of its way to make you feel welcome. If you are traveling for a good length of time, you will be pleased to know a laundromat is next door on one side, and a dry cleaner is on the other. Not to mention all the great restaurants and shopping within walking distance. Don't rent a car - use UBER or walk! We also enjoyed their breakfast and tea and cookies in the afternoon. If you're looking for a respite in the city, you should consider this lovely hotel.",16-Jan-17,4    Golden Gate Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d74052-Reviews-Golden_Gate_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html
263,"I loved this little boutique hotel/B and B. It has a wonderful feel the minute you walk in. The staff is very accommodating and they make you feel instantly at home. The great surprise is the antique elevator that works perfectly but takes you back fifty or so years. I absolutely loved the elevator with its beautiful engravings. I can still hear the gate close to signal you are on your way up or down. The rooms are tastefully decorated but a little tight on space. We stayed at the beginning and at the end of our California adventure. When we arrived at the end of our trip we had suitcases and bags enough for a two year around -the -world adventure. (The shopping at second-hand boutiques is AMAZING in California)The staff quickly and promptly helped us and delivered them to our room without a second thought. Breakfasts were limited to croissants, juice, tea and coffee etc. I feel that is something they could improve on. Lastly, the location is fabulous. Macy's and the tours buses are just a short stroll around the corner and down the hill.",2-Jan-17,4    Golden Gate Hotel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d74052-Reviews-Golden_Gate_Hotel-San_Francisco_California.html

The staff were all so welcoming and friendly, we felt right at home with a nice cup of tea and cookies. We had a room with shared bathroom, we never had to wait to use and always felt clean. We loved the decore of the place and the breakfast was great. The staff really couldnt do more for us.

This made me very happy indeed – that and the upgrade on the room. Thank you very much! The bed was the most comfortable I've slept in and the shower was terrific, too. At breakfast, I chatted to the other guests over pastries and many coffees. I encouraged Cookie the dog and Pip the cat to say ""hello"", missing my own ginger cat at home. I borrowed a guidebook from reception and was given a few helpful tips on where to go. I have only good words and thoughts about this hotel.

267,"My daughter and I spent three days at this cosy, charming boutique hotel that is very well located near the prime San Francisco shopping district of Union Square. This was my first visit to San Francisco and I will always remember it for its beautiful bridge, fantastic shopping, multiple sights, and the Golden Gate Hotel. We had a room with its own bathroom that was decorated in a style reminiscent of earlier last century. The bed was very comfortable. There are plenty of fluffy white towels, and reliable free wifi. Tariffs include a delicious continental breakfast of croissants and muffins with tea or coffee and fresh orange juice. Afternoon tea of fresh cookies and delicious blackberry tea served in the gorgeous lounge room in front of an open fire just top off a day in this beautiful bay city. The staff are exceptional - capable as well as personable.

Administration is formidable and the look inside the rooms makes you fill a hundred years ago. A lot of good taste in decoration, PEP (Adorable pet) welcomes you every time you go to the entrance of the hotel. We had a very good experience if you are looking for something not to expensive, old style, breakfast and the tea time every afternoon, without no more expense.

269,"We stayed here for four nights on our first trip to San Francisco. The hotel was built in 1913 and retains many original features including the lift. There is a Manx cat called Pip who patrols the reception area and, one day, miaowed outside our door with a view to inspecting our room. The staff are charming and helpful and you can leave your car in the car park opposite - very convenient. The bed was comfortable, the plumbing serviceable and the location very central. Breakfast was simple but ample and the tea and biscuits at 16:00 are a civilised touch. I hope to return to San Francisco one day and, when I do, I will definitely stay at The Golden Gate Hotel.

We were even surprised to find a fridge in our room, a godsend for us as the wife drinks loads of water.There is also a coffee machine in the room which was great.We went for breakfast the next day and the breakfast room was quiet (everyone away to the gay pride parade i think). It was a bit steep in price at 24 dollars each but it was good but not great.The next few days were good and we were only 2 minutes walk to Union Square.on the day of checkout, I asked for a late checkout as our flight was at 20-40 that evening but it cost me 110 dollars, again a bit steep but we only had the 2 minor quibbles.",7-Jul-19,5    San Francisco Marriott Union Square,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d124765-Reviews-San_Francisco_Marriott_Union_Square-San_Francisco_California.html

277,I am a dedicated Marriott customer and have enjoyed my stays at all of the properties I've stayed at thus far but I think Marriott Union Square is at the top of the list.

278,"The San Francisco Marriott Union Square is in a excellent location near, you guessed it, Union Square. I arrived at the hotel in the evening, and, as a Titanium Elite Bonvoyer, I was informed that I was having a room upgrade. The person who checked me in was very friendly. I went to the room, on one of the upper floors and was startled as to how small the room was. I know big city hotels mean smaller rooms, but not only was the room small, the bathroom was absolutely tiny. That said, I had a very comfortable sleep in the Marriott bed. The concierge lounge was fine, and it provided the standard Marriott fare. I like that they are not offering bottled water in the concierge lounge. Rather, they have glass bottles and a dispenser of still and sparkling water. It would have been nice if these bottles had lids, but it's good to see them reducing the amount of plastic they use. I was very eager to order some lunch through room service, but surprisingly, they only do room service for breakfast and dinner. I'm not sure why I could not have the turkey club at 2 pm that they are willing to bring me at 5 pm. But everyone I dealt with at the hotel was friendly and courteous. I'm not sure if all of the rooms were this small, but I still stay at this property again.",2-Jun-19,5    San Francisco Marriott Union Square,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d124765-Reviews-San_Francisco_Marriott_Union_Square-San_Francisco_California.html
279,"I'm a very loyal Marriott fan and have stayed at most of the properties in SF and been very happy with them. This isn't one of my favorites, although in fairness the location is handy and the room was updated and large, but there was only a shower. At check in, I wasn't offered my Lifetime Platinum automatic upgrade at check in and I assumed that I received it. My room was low and right over the cable car, which made it extremely noisy from early morning until around midnight. The HVAC fan was so loud, even on the low setting, I had to turn the system off to be able to sleep and was very cold all night long. I was too busy to be able to request a room change as this was a work trip. At check-out I asked if they considered my room an upgrade and the desk clerk said, ""definitely not"" and said I didn't receive one because I checked in online - in response to the two messages I received from Marriott urging me to do so. He said that resulted in my receiving the ""first available"" room instead of the upgrade I was expecting (why the desk clerk didn't ask if I wanted that instead of an upgrade, I don't know). A few months ago I stayed at a different SF Marriott, checked in online and was offered an upgrade at check in. So it seems this is a property issue, and it's bad policy and poor customer service. If these things don't matter to you, this hotel is fine. But for the price, I will choose a different Marriott next time I'm in the city.",2-Jun-19,5    San Francisco Marriott Union Square,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d124765-Reviews-San_Francisco_Marriott_Union_Square-San_Francisco_California.html

281,This is by far the WORST Marriott I have ever stayed. The concierge staff is so RUDE. I never again will stay at this hotel due to customer service and general cleanliness.

285,"From check-in through my four-night stay, everything at the Marriott Union Square was just perfect - my new favorite hotel in San Francisco!I arrived a little bit before check-in time, and my new buddy Jeff at the front desk not only arranged to get me into my room early, he tap-tap-tapped away at the keyboard to upgrade me to a lovely corner room, a spacious junior suite-sized room with huge windows on two sides, making the room feel even bigger. (Thanks, Jeff!!!)The layout of these corner rooms is great, with a small entryway (complete with small bar area and fridge). There's a sliding door separating the rest of the room from the rather large bathroom having a floor-to-ceiling window, big sink and vanity, and a nicely sized shower with rainfall shower head. Most impressive was the new décor - this hotel has obviously been renovated recently, having a much more modern feel than the Marriotts of years past. This sense of design extends throughout the hotel, with artwork in the hallways and a small yet nicely furnished lobby. With only 18 rooms on each floor, the hotel has a nice boutique feel to it, very very different than most large city properties with hundreds of rooms. The small size also makes the hotel remarkably quiet, a big plus when it's time to visit slumber-land.Just like Jeff, all of the staff I interacted with here was great, including the kind folks in the Concierge Lounge who made sure we were well-taken care of from breakfast through evening snacks, as well as with helping us use the automated wine dispenser - tap your room key and hit 'pour'! The hotel is also quite eco-friendly, offering bottles that you can fill up with either still or sparkling water and take back to your room. No having to lug bottles of water from CVS or Walgreens here! The lounge has a nice view of Union Square and points south, especially nice in the evening when everything's lit up.I really like the location of this property. Unlike the larger properties south of Market, this hotel is just one block north of Union Square, making it a really good location for doing anything around the Square (including shopping and going to the San Francisco Playhouse, a must-do while in town). It doesn't take long to get to Chinatown, the Financial District, North Beach, or the Ferry Marketplace, and it's a short walk to the Muni/BART stations. (Use Montgomery rather than Powell - a nicer walk.) The Powell Street cablecar line is quite literally at your doorstep, making trips to Fisherman's Wharf (Powell-Mason) and Ghirardelli Square (Powell-Hyde) quite easy... and I have to admit to being like a little kid in the late evenings, looking out the northerly windows of my room to watch the cablecars go by. After my four nights here, this room was hard to say goodbye to, but now that I've discovered this gem of a Marriott right in the center of the action, I know where I'll be bedding down on future trips to San Francisco.

We want to stay close to Union Square and picked JW Marriott Union Square Hotel.At the front desk, we were warmly greeted and welcomed to the renovated JW Marriott Hotel. To made this trip extra special, a bottle of wine and selected cheeseboard was delivered that evening to make the visit more festive.Our room 1104 came with two queen beds; large sitting area sofa, bar chair & high table; desk and chair; large 55-inch HDTV screen; and coffee maker. We requested a mini refrigerator (no charge) to hold our toddler food.Our room had gleaming rosewood and cherry finishes. The wallpaper was a shiny dark grey color. The view was on to Mason Street with a great view of the building across the street and its occupants as well as rooftops of other buildings.There were 1-USB port and 2-electric plugs on the 2 bed posts next to night stand, 2-USB and 2-plugs on the clock, 1-USB and 1-plug at desk.The bathroom has spacious area around sink vanity with quartz top, expansive walk-in shower & spray, and beautifully decorated marble tiles on the floor and walls with accent offset running border of quartz, metal, and glass. The water closet is a separate alcove with shiny dark grey wallpaper.The room was very comfortable.There are four elevators and they are super fast. Once inside the elevator, I had a bird's eye view of the entire hotel interior core as the elevator goes flying up to the upper floors. The elevators are super quick and quiet. The central core of the building is well design with guest rooms on the exterior with inside walkway all around. There are no interior rooms, but from the walkway you can look upward to the rooftop where natural light streams into the building and look downward to the lobby & restaurant below. Natural lighting provides a very comfortable atmosphere.The fitness gym is good size with good variety of equipment along with HDTV, towels, earplugs, magazines, hot & cold water dispenser, and fresh apples. There is a separate room with large floor space ideal for group exercises, pilates, yogi, and other activities. The lobby level have their all day dining restaurant along with bar. The lounge area was especially nice since it was on far side of lobby level away from the front desk, restaurant, and bar making it a more intimate setting for sitting & relaxing. There are 3 square tables with seating for 8, one rectangular table and 4 alcoves with seating for 4, and 2 tables for 2. This is an ideal place to work solo or in groups with a quiet atmosphere.

290,"Stayed for 3 nights while visiting family. Picked hotel because of the good location. Service was more than accomodating and cheerful. Offered a suite when we checked in (husband is platinum) and it offered great views and plenty of room. Only issue I felt in room was when I tried to close the blackening shades in the evening, it was hard to reach the pulls as they were right behind the big TV & desk. Not very convenient. Went to Concierge Level Sunday evening - disappointed in sliders (bun, piece of lettuce, dry cold bacon), so just had nibbles.

This hotel Lounge usually has some kind of sandwich dish, a hot finger food dish, cheese, and hummus. I wish they had a soup and maybe a salad leafy greens dish.

Really like their water bottles, you can pick up a bottle and fill it with the type of water you like and take it to the room. Much better and environment friendly option.During my stay there was some maintenance work on the same floor as I was staying, it was bit noisy and inconvenient.

300,We stayed here for two nights while we were in San Francisco to meet up with family after Christmas. Nice hotel but the best thing about it is the location. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. Union Square is just up the block and we caught the cable car around the corner. We were traveling with 3 young children and there was a McDonalds right across the street. We were able to avoid the expensive parking fees by finding a lot off site at half the price. The driver had a 10-15 minute walk to get the car but since we didn’t need it during our stay it was no big deal. Rooms were very clean. Service was great.

302,Stayed here two nights on my way back to Sydney. Was a good location (close to Union Square) and had nice rooms. Had an upper floor (22nd) which was high enough to drown out street vehicle noise and late night bar shenanigans. Room was clean and furnished nicely...only minus was the blue light that the bar fridge (if you can call it that as it was empty) gave off at night and lite the room with the temperature of the fridge...bit annoying when you like a fully dark room at night. Ended up laying a pillow between it and myself in the bed to block it out. Front desk (checkin and checkout) experience was pleasant and had a positive experience all around. Would stay here again when next in SFO.,6-Jan-19,5    San Francisco Marriott Union Square,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d124765-Reviews-San_Francisco_Marriott_Union_Square-San_Francisco_California.html
303,"My husband and I stayed here a few years, and as we had a good experience, I thought to book here for a business trip. I would not have done that while the strike was ongoing, but fortunately the strike ended about a week before my trip. Perhaps because the strike led to some very poor reviews and/or turned off prospective guests, I got a very competitive room rate.Through my Marriott app, I told the hotel that I would be arriving around 1. Much to my surprise, not only was my room ready for occupancy upon my arrival, but the staff person who checked me in offered a slightly larger room on a high floor! This hotel’s location is perfect for those who come to San Francisco to shop, and it’s incredibly easy to get an Uber. For me the best feature (new since my last visit) was the excellent gym. It includes 2 spinning bikes, connected to a screen that offers professional teachers leading a wide variety of “classes.” Additionally, there are several treadmills, elliptical, weights, kettlebells and mats.",30-Dec-18,5    San Francisco Marriott Union Square,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d124765-Reviews-San_Francisco_Marriott_Union_Square-San_Francisco_California.html
304,"Stayed here for a conference. The hotel was okay. Nothing spectacular. I expected better for the marriott chain. The room was extremely small. And in this day and age, they wanted 15 bux a day to get on the wifi. Pretty much everywhere I have stayed in the last few years, Wifi was always included in the price of the hotel room, even in like Low end hotels. It’s just surprising that Marriott would not include free wifi. The area around the hotel isn’t the greatest either as the city has undergone a huge decline. The second you step outside the hotel you see a lot of homeless people sleeping on the streets and panhandlers begging for money.",16-Dec-18,5    San Francisco Marriott Union Square,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d124765-Reviews-San_Francisco_Marriott_Union_Square-San_Francisco_California.html

Services were reduced, but given the location so close to shops and restaurants in the city it really wasn't a problem. Would not hesitate to stay here again despite all the activities going on outside.

308,arrived today and faced similar surprise as other reviewers. Active strike going on with very loud protesters at hotel entrance. Lobby under renovation and no meal service available except breakfast. Front desk staff were incredibly understanding and professional.

310,Came here with my family for 4 nights over Thanksgiving holiday. My husband is a platinum SPG/Marriott member so we used hard earned points. A never ending strike is happening so the front entrance is ridiculously LOUD with hostile strikers. Then we had to show our identification and key cards every time we enter the building despite the fact it’s the same guy. Skeleton crew in restaurant and no room service. Vending machine not working properly but front desk wouldn’t refund our money and said we have to go to manager.... seriously!?

312,This is a nicely located and maintained property with well appointed rooms that are comfortable. Public spaces rather limited and rather cold.

313,"A sign of a great hotelier is their ability to provide impeccable service through a happy workforce. If the latter aren't happy the former falls apart. This inevitably means the customers at the hotel suffer. Let me ask any of you reading this review - why settle for compromise when your money can get you better than this experience?This was the first time I've ever stayed at a Marriott. Seeing how poorly the senior management staff have handled these strikes has left such a negative impression on me that I shall take my future custom to hotels where staff are respected much more than this.I've been left hugely disappointed, I'm afraid.",18-Nov-18,5    San Francisco Marriott Union Square,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d124765-Reviews-San_Francisco_Marriott_Union_Square-San_Francisco_California.html
314,"I stayed here several nights while the union hotel workers were on strike (and still are 30 days later). The location is terrific and tucked into downtown near Union Square. There was no housekeeping truly offered and no room service. Minus the mess with the Union strike, this is a good hotel to stay at if you want to be near Union Square. The hotel feels old-Marriott, ""it's time for a remodel"" at this location. The lobby is old, the rooms feel older and not sure I will stay at this property anytime again soon.

Carried our own heavy luggage to ou room and found a note informing there would be no bar no restaurant no room service no cleaning in fact no services we were just paying full price for a room and basic breakfast. All of this would have been acceptable in the circumstances had there been a hint of how we would be compensated. Such bad customer relations left a bad taste and we will never use a Marriott group again. They have since refunded 1 nights stay , little to late.

The room we were given was perfect, a corner room which was a little larger, on a high floor with a great view of Union Square. We could still hear the strikers, but barely. The location was perfect for our needs. We had access to the Concierge Lounge on Thursday night (it's closed on Fri, Sat, Sun), and met Geoffrey who was a perfect gentleman. We've stayed in the Marriott Courtyard on Post, which is fine, but the rooms are very small. This hotel was much better.

318,"The unionize staff are picketing from 700AM to 1000PM making enough noise that they can be heard for blocks. The hotel services were impacted - no food, no laundry, no bar service. The hotel did not warn me at the time of booking that they were under strike action for the past month. I was essentially told at check in of the issue and given the last minute nature of the information had no choice but to grin and bear it. I was forced to cross a picket line and harassed as a result. To top it all off there were no towels in the room and the shower drain was clogged. There was no compensation or accommodation by the hotel staff. The lack of notification, in my opinion is their strategy to avoid customers choosing alternate accommodations. Despite expressing my dissatisfaction management did little and aside sending a patronizing email promising to bring up the issue with management have done nothing to retain my business. I recommend against staying at the Marriott chain while the strike action continues unless they make customers aware especially of the reduced services.",4-Nov-18,5    San Francisco Marriott Union Square,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d124765-Reviews-San_Francisco_Marriott_Union_Square-San_Francisco_California.html

322,"The strike made for a very difficult stay. You needed earplugs as you approached from a block away. At check in we requested a room off the street and that was honored. The doors are such that trying to close them quietly is impossible which added to sleep issues from neighboring rooms. The first indication regarding the strike and lack of service was a letter in the room. It offered 500 points to rewards members if daily cleaning service wasn’t provided. Our tv didn’t work but was fixed the following day. It appeared that only a couple of 4 elevators were working. If you were on the 8th floor or lower and needed to get to the lobby you were pretty much out of luck. Our room was cleaned one day but on Sunday someone showed up at our room around 8pm to ask if we wanted clean towels. No cleaning that day. At check out we were told that we had 3 days of internet service to pay for but they would comp it. My husband said it should have been included as a silver elite member. The clerk said his number wasn’t noted and waved us on our way. I had thought I supplied the number when using Chase points for the reservation. I’ve never been at a Marriott property where they didn’t ask if you were a rewards member so we assumed it was on file. So no 500 points for no service either.

I cant enjoy the breakfast because the hotel staff cranks the music to try to drown out the loud speakers, drums, cowbells and chants but it doesn't work.

325,"Decent enough hostel. Hostel is located reasonably close to public transport and buses - it's pretty easy to get there from the airport. It is located a bit far away from a lot of tourist sites, but they are reasonably accessible through public transport, and it's close to a lot of good, cheap restaurants. Breakfast is provided, although it is quite basic.The rooms are good. Power points at beds and under-bed lockers (mesh design, bring your own padlock). Linen and towels are provided, showers and toilets are shared, there can sometimes be an availability issue when it's busy.Only major issue was that the hostel is under-staffed for it's size. Waits at check in and check out can be quite long, but it you're arriving outside of 'peak' times, it's probably not an issue.Complaints about location are all correct. It's located close to the Tenderloin, a neighbourhood with a poor reputation, and at night and during the day, there can be a lot of transient people around. That said, it's not exactly unsafe, sometimes can just be a bit unpleasant. If you've lived in a big city before, it's not exactly something that's going to be unfamiliar. I'd keep in mind that there are definitely some streets nearby that I wouldn't walk down after dark if you are obviously a tourist.",7-Jul-19,6    HI San Francisco Downtown Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d265328-Reviews-HI_San_Francisco_Downtown_Hostel-San_Francisco_California.html
326,"Nice hostel with friendly personell, good service and a nice price compared to other places in SF. However, it can be crowded sometimes with groups of people checking in and out the whole day. This makes the service less available and can be annoying when you need to take a bath, are kept awake or want to have breakfast (which is pretty poor). Allthough it lays in downtown San Francisco, the location is not very good for visiting tourist attractions. For shopping it is, but that is mostly not where you take a hostel for. At night there are a lot of homeless people on the streets, so when you are a smoker... be prepared.

Good breakfast available in the common room.,9-May-19,6    HI San Francisco Downtown Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d265328-Reviews-HI_San_Francisco_Downtown_Hostel-San_Francisco_California.html
332,"The best thing about this hostel is it’s location right next to Union Square and the Powell St transit hub. There are plenty of late night and 24 hour food options all around this place. Really, the location could hardly be better.The accommodations were OK. My room was clean and roomy. Breakfast was limited but nice to have. The bed was a little annoying because the sheets wouldn’t stay on it. They need new sheets that fit the mattresses. Otherwise, no complaints.",27-Mar-19,6    HI San Francisco Downtown Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d265328-Reviews-HI_San_Francisco_Downtown_Hostel-San_Francisco_California.html
333,"It was my first time in a hostel, and I didn't know how it will be. Before I arrived here, I walked to another Hostel. So please be careful about which Hostel you're searching on google or maps.me.The employees are very kind, and the hostel is clean. I had a four male room. You should bring your locker. They all have a sink in the room. The bed is ok as it is a hostel. So don't expect a boxspring bed. They have activities, sometimes for free, a big lounge and a theater, where you can hang out. There are enough plugs everywhere in the room to charge your devices. They offer a generously complimentary breakfast with bagels, oatmeal, fruits, and coffee. The location is perfect.

334,We opted for the hostel during our short stay at SFO and were impressed by the efficient no-nonsense nature of the facilities. The hostel itself is conveniently located from the nearest BART station (we disembarked at Powell St and walked up) so the commute to/from the SFO international airport was not much of a headache. The private room allocated to us was on 2nd floor facing the Niko hotel and it was well appointed. The front desk staff briskly ran us through the usual do/do-nots and off we were to settle in and go about on our business.The usual revelry and noisy nature of hostels is absent here - which is a great thing. The general noises from the street have never been a bother and in fact it is something that adds a bit of life to the general stay in the room. Housekeeping staff do a fantastic job of cleaning up the room and turning it around. Lots and lots of good eating places and other tourist-y things abound. The hostel lobby has a proper schedule of activities which can sign up for and participate. The staff and hostel guests go a long way in eliminating the feeling of a sterile place and instead there is emphasis on celebrating together and swapping stories.,30-Jan-19,6    HI San Francisco Downtown Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d265328-Reviews-HI_San_Francisco_Downtown_Hostel-San_Francisco_California.html
335,"I stayed here twice, before and after taking a connecting a flight to Tahiti. It is so so convenient if you need a place to stay before flying on. Just a short journey away from SFO airport. Take the bart directly to Powell str, walk about 10 mins or less and you're there ! Nice breakfast, everyone I spoke to staying there was friendly. As a solo traveller who just wanted to rest, i liked that it had a vibe where everyone sort of kept to themselves. It's quite big so this makes sense. However there seemed to be plenty of bar crawls, bike tours etc if you are feeling social. Sometimes the showers were cold so I would go on a hunt to find a hot one and was usually successful. Staff were so helpful and friendly. Bought a padlock for 5 dollas. Chill areas were supet cosy. Grocery store like 2 doors away. Would stay again.",15-Jan-19,6    HI San Francisco Downtown Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d265328-Reviews-HI_San_Francisco_Downtown_Hostel-San_Francisco_California.html
336,"Please see the email below that we sent management about our experience at this hostel. We have had little response hence posting it as part of the review. On a side note the lift facilities are downright dangerous for a disabled traveller. Sometimes the gap between the floor level of the lift and building was up to 5 inches too high or too low and impassable on a mobility device. Hi,My name is Stephen Abraham. I am a disabled traveller visiting with my wife and son from Australia and current staying at the Hostel International San Francisco Downtown.I'd like to report an incident last night which has left us in distress.This is our first experience in a hostel and we have been looking forward to it for over a year. As we were driving into San Fran I rang the front desk to ask if there was somewhere we could disembark and then park the car temporarily. I informed her I required disabled parking. The lady on the phone told us there was nowhere to disembark and told us the nearest garage was at 525 Jones street - a very long way away for someone on a mobility scooter with cases and mobility aids to carry. After 30 minutes driving in circles looking for somewhere closer we pulled up illegally outside the hostel on Mason Street and I told my wife to cross the road the Mason O'farrel Downtown Garage and ask if we could park there. She ran back and found out we could! We had been driving in circles in heavy stressful traffic for no reason!When we checked in yesterday (31st of December) there were two people on staff and quite a queue so we waited patiently to check in. We were given our keys, asked about where best to view the New Years Eve fireworks, and went to settle in after a stressful time driving in in our hire car. We were given the wrong room names and my son had to line up again to sort out the problem. All of this we could write off as New Year's Eve pressure at a busy time. But our next experience we could not.When we arrived back at the hostel after the midnight fireworks and an awful Uber driver who challenged me about my disability, we came back to the hostel. There were many people arriving too. The office person (Ernesto I think) was yelling at people to show their room keys. As we had not been told we needed them to enter the building after 12pm (despite asking at check in about viewing the midnight fireworks) I had left my key in the room. My wife (taken aback to being yelled and told that her disabled husband couldn't enter the building) went to tell Ernesto that we hadn't been told this. He yelled back that was for our safety and that I couldn't enter without my key. My wife again taken aback at his forceful attitude went upstairs to get it for me. She came back and as she showed it again went to say that we hadn't been told this. Ernesto's response was awful. He told my wife she has a bad attitude and he wouldn't speak to her because she was being abusive. All she wanted to say was that we weren't told about the after 12pm key policy!We went to our room shaken, in tears and unable to sleep after this incident.I am sure that it was stressful for Ernesto being the only person on staff whilst many were attempting to come in the building. However: 1) it is not our fault that he was the only person there. 2) It was not our fault that he was stressed.3) It was not our fault that we weren't told the policy. We would like to formally complain about this treatment. My wife is a professional educator who deals with stressful situations everyday. She is carer for a disabled person. She does not deserve to be treated in this way.I'd like a response within 48 hours please and don't want to have to take this matter further.",7-Jan-19,6    HI San Francisco Downtown Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d265328-Reviews-HI_San_Francisco_Downtown_Hostel-San_Francisco_California.html
337,"The best thing about this hostel is the location. I only stayed the night because I was passing thru SF before heading out of the country and I wanted to explore the city before I went. Unfortunately, I was there during SantaCon, traffic was shear madness and drunk people were everywhere. I say unfortunately because I almost missed my flight because the shuttle could not pick me up due to the gridlock traffic. This was not the hostel's fault. They were kind enough to get me to the subway so that I could make it to the airport. Okay, so about the hostel. It was clean, there is an elevator for your convenience or for anyone that is walking-impaired. They offer various activities on what seems to be a daily basis. Each bed has a light and electrical outlets along with USB ports. My room was somewhat clean but I will say I did arrive very late into the night and had roommates already in the room. However, when I dropped something behind the bed and I reached down to grab it, I noticed a few things left behind by previous tenants. I had a 4-bunk, female only room with a shared bathroom and even though the bed was fairly comfortable, the room was cold and you can hear just about every goings-on in the room next door or outside the room door. The bathroom seems like wasted space and could use more hooks on the barren walls. No soap given nor was there any soap in the dispenser in the shower. I guess it is a good thing I travel with soap, just in case. Regarding breakfast, there were some decent offerings (oatmeal, toast, bagels, cereal, juices, coffee, etc...) but get there early because it is like a feeding frenzy. You are expected to wash your own dishes though. Small price to pay for a bit of free breakfast. One improvement would be curtains on the beds for privacy, especially when your roommates have different schedules than yourself.",29-Dec-18,6    HI San Francisco Downtown Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d265328-Reviews-HI_San_Francisco_Downtown_Hostel-San_Francisco_California.html

339,"I have stayed in Hostelling International in NYC on previous occasions as a solo traveller and really enjoyed the experience. This time round I chose HISF travelling with hubby and son and was not disappointed.Although the triple bed room ( bunkstyle) is small (really too small for 3 people) it was still great value for staying in downtown San Francisco near Market Street attractions and shops. It also provided basic continental breakfast to start the day and staff were friendly. It is mainly serves the purpose to provide a bed and did not disappoint although 2 consecutive days of rain in SF holed us up more than we would have liked in the small room. Only downside besides the small room, was how muggy the room were and that the mattresses were a bit worn out, resulting us having, after a 3 day stay, some sore backs. But all in all a decent facility providing a safe and clean place to stay in SF at very good pricing. Will certainly choose it again.

The staff gave me a wrong piece of information about the locations I asked about. It is located in a really bad neighborhood that should have been mentioned.

Check in was smooth and the staff were very helpful throughout our stay. We booked a private double room with ensuite. The room was very clean and the bed was really comfy, the room was quite loud from street noise but staying in the heart of the city that will happen. The room was an ok size but we never had a lot of storage space just a really small alcove in the wall with a small rail where you could hang about 5 things up. There was 2 communal areas on our floor which were well kept and also laundry machines to use which came in handy and were cheap to use. We had breakfast here one morning but it was very busy and obviously being a hostel you had to do your own dishes etc. The hostel is a great location which is what sold it for me.

The breakfast was very good and they recycle the waste from the kitchen and the fist floor. The staff is very friendly. We arrived early and they let us leave our luggage in a special room so we can explore the city until the hour of our check in.

Our room was 318, located in front of the stairs and looking out on the alleyway, I got really scared of the traffic noise but walls and doors are thick and could barely hear any noise. Bed was comfy, daily cleaning of our room, common spaces clean as well. Free breakfast is included but we never tried it. Location is great because you can walk to everywhere BUT you are 100m from the Tenderloin (worst neighbourhood) so you see a lot of homeless, drug addicts, mental illness. I arrived solo the first night and was prettified. The only one thing that tinted our experience is that the room was charged twice on my credit card. You can imagine it’s a good amount when you spent 5 nights. The blonde girl at the front desk looked at me like I was either stupid or annoying so she referred me to her colleague. He did try and find the info but didn’t solve the problem. In the end visa had to call them to cancel tat duplicate.. pretty annoying to spend an entire day of you vacation off the phone.

345,"We aren’t usually “hostel people” but due to the price of this hostel in comparison to other hotels in the area we thought we would give it a go. I am so glad we did. We had a private double ensuite room on the 2nd floor. The room was clean, and it was so cosy, much more personal than a hotel it felt like we were staying in a bedroom. The room was a good size and plenty cupboard space for our suitcases. I also liked the fact a hairdryer was provided and linen and towels too. The hostel also has several communal areas which were clean and well kept. We did attempt breakfast once but it was so busy we didn’t return. There was a big convention on in SF and I know the hostel was fully booked so that is nothing against the hostel and just bad timing of our visit. Staff were helpful and booked airport transport for us when requested. The hostel is centrally located and a 5 minute walk to Union Square and close to many bars and restaurants. I felt safe in the area, and in the hostel and they had security on checking the passes of everyone who was entering the building. Yes the area is noisy, but it’s the middle of a city and in an old building. Ear plugs were given and we both felt we slept well.

Even though it is a very old building for the price I was expecting at least a clean room. The room is serviced daily but sometimes the towels were taken and not replaced. Some front desk staff are very friendly and others quite rude. The location is ok but there is a lot of noise from the street all night and bright lights shone in from the parking lot next door since there is only a thin curtain. The free breakfast was tasty but there is not enough seating in the kitchen. ,23-Sep-18,6    HI San Francisco Downtown Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d265328-Reviews-HI_San_Francisco_Downtown_Hostel-San_Francisco_California.html

The bathroom was super clean, and the queen-sized bed was comfortable enough. I stayed on the third floor, so had close proximity to the kitchen and water cooler - a definite plus! The location is quite good - central and accessible to most sites. Oh, and make sure you check out Cafe Mason, which is right next to the hostel. Would highly recommend their Croque Madame and pumpkin pancakes. CONS: The only downside to my accommodation experience here was the noise. Be warned: if you stay in a street-facing room (mine faced Mason Street), you will be in for a racket at night. There were several nights when a dude played drums right outside Pinecrest Diner, which is right across from the hostel, and did so for two hours plus from midnight to 2 AM. Needless to say, then, I didn't have great quality of sleep during my week's stay at the hostel. Yes, there were free earplugs in my room, but they did not quite mitigate the loudness coming from the streets. It's not really the hostel's fault, but if I were to give a suggestion for improvement, perhaps the hostel could make the walls and rooms more sound-proof.

We were able to store our bags on the day we checked out as we had a late flight, this was very helpful and convenient. The not so great is mainly to do with noise levels. We were in a room at the back, which we initially thought would be quieter.. not so much. The lane that we were looking into was a hive of activity.. noisy activity each night. In addition we saw peope shooting up and smoking drugs in there. Additionally, there was music that kept coming into our room from early in the morning. It was not coming from the room next door or the common room.. it was coming out of the floor. Totally bizarre. It was loud enough to record on my phone and play back clearly. The hostel is clean, beds are comfy and room was spacious. The area, whilst close to things is not so desirable, however there are far more expensive hotels in exactly the same area with the same smell of wee and homeless people hassling them too...

However I was greeted by the most unimpressed staff member who would not give me any extra information I might need unless I asked for it. The laundry facilities are cheap, but no instructions are given in the room as to how the payment/dryer works. There is a change machine so that you can buy detergent from the vending machine, but then the washers and dryers require you to swipe your card to activate them? I also found out later that you pay for as many dryer cycles as you require, and that one cycle doesn't just do the job. So I spent the rest of my night trying to air dry my clothes in my room, which I'm sure my dorm mates didn't appreciate. The bed light did not work for me and when I brought the issue up with reception, she wrote it down and said she would get maintenance to look into it. Later that day when I went back and the light issue still wasn't fixed, I went down to reception to ask them again. I was met with the same unimpressed lady who could not give a crap that something was wrong. She said 'oh if it's been reported to maintenance that's all we can do'.

364,"I stayed here for a week in two different private queen rooms.The first was on the fourth floor was very basic, outdated but clean. They could do with double glazing as the windows did nothing to stop the draughts or block any of the sounds from the street. The bathroom was large and had lots of hot water.The second was nicer on the 6th floor. It had double glazing and a nicer finish to the room. But the hairdryer was broken.The hostel is a big one so it’s up to you if you want to socialise or not. They do various activities each day if you want to get involved.I didn’t find the reception staff particularly friendly or helpful to be honest. One time I stood waiting for the lift for 10mins to take my bag to the 6th floor. I checked the lift was actually working with reception staff and they spoke to me like I was stupid then chose to ignore me for a further 10mins as it still hadn’t arrived.

368,"This was the first stop on my 6-week trip across the USA. After landing at LAX, then finding out my flight up to San Francisco was delayed, then cancelled, then I was rebooked on the next flight which was also delayed, meant I arrived about 4hrs after I expected too. Upon check in my card kept declining (plenty of money on it, turns out that card would only work at Starbucks and a few food places haha, don’t even know why) the girls were lovely and asked if I had another card after trying a couple times. I did and everything was good. They were really lovely and when I mentioned I was from Melbourne, one of the girls mentioned she had been there earlier in the year and we had a good chat about how the two cities were pretty similar in a lot of ways (which is legit Melbourne and San Francisco are the same vibe it’s great) and this was a great start to my time in San Francisco as I was absolutely exhausted after the long flight from Melbourne, plus the flight cancelation/delays, definitely helped perk me up a lot to have a friendly chat!The hostel itself was clean and comfy, and loved that the beds each had a panel with a light, USB ports and a power point too. Plus lockers under the bed are handy. And being a tall person, it was nice to be able to sit up in my bottom bunk and not be hunched over or hitting my head, as they gave ample room! The room I was in had a sink which was cool, made for a quick teeth brushing/face washing easy. Breakfast was lovely. A variety of fruits and oats, plus toast and bagels, and juice or tea/coffee. The location itself is very good, just a short walk down the Powell street station, which is where the BART from San Francisco airport stops so it’s good if you’re catching the BART from the airport. Close to lots of food places and bars, plus the Westfield if you need some retail therapy. The historic cable car is just around the corner near the train too, which I recommend to any visitors, it’s a lovely ride down to fishermans wharf!The building is safe and secure, with staff checking your room keycard upon entry to ensure only guests are coming in.

This is centrally located hostel, near to Union Square and Powell St Cable Car Turnaround -- one of the attractions you have to experience when you are in SF.5. Staffs were nice and helpful. They let me use the kitchen and stay at the hostel waiting for my late night Megabus to Los Angeles6.

372,"FYI: I stayed in a double room with en suite bathroom.This room was not cheap, but importantly it was clean and the location was convenient. You might think that this would be like a hotel room but in a hostel, but that wasn't quite the case. The room didn't quite have all the things a hotel room might have such as an iron, a fridge or a TV but that didn't really bother me too much. I didn't visit to watch TV. In the shower, instead of little toiletries, I got a soap dispenser that cheerfully suggested I should give it a try (I don't remember the wording but I'm pretty sure it had an ""!"" at the end).The bed was comfortable enough, with bedside lighting, and there were power sockets to charge my phone. The wifi was string in my room and nice and speedy. The walls were roughly and colourfully painted as you'd expect in a hostel. But let's move on to the windows.These single windows could be opened upwards and were large and let in a decent amount of light. However they were only one pane thick so being in downtown SF and only one storey up, it was VERY noisy. In the window sills outside there was a bed of various detritus - not a nice thing to look at or even to stand near. None of these were deal breakers - the noise might have been but flights and touristy activities meant I was too exhausted to miss out on sleep but if you're a light sleeper consider asking if there's a more suitable room - or go elsewhere.The hostel itself was okay, communal areas are okay and breakfast is provided. Here you walk into the kitchen and take some fruit or a bagel and spoon on a topping. Cutlery is freely available but you are expected to wash it all yourself once you've finished. It's actually very well run - such a thing could easily descend into chaos but supplies are regularly replenished and washed up things are put away promptly.The staff are friendly and helpful and the cleaners do a thorough job around the building. There is a very handy convenience store right next door. The location of this hostel is extremely central, but it's a fair walk to the docks over some steep hills. The trolley service is right next to you though so that's one way to crest the hills.",12-Nov-17,6    HI San Francisco Downtown Hostel,http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60713-d265328-Reviews-HI_San_Francisco_Downtown_Hostel-San_Francisco_California.html

We booked a private queen room with a shared bathroom. The room was really tidy and clean when we arrived- with some towels and complimentary shampoo. Our room was a bit muggy so we had to keep the fan on most of the time. We also couldn’t turn the heating off which came on most nights! The breakfast was okay, not much choice, but it’s free so can’t complain! They take security quite seriously and you have to show you room card every time you enter reception for them to let you up to your room- always good to feel secure in a city you’ve never visited before. The showers were a bit grungy and there’s not much room to put your clothes, towel, etc. But it’s easy enough to put up with for a few nights.

401,"Reserved a Private single bed room for two nights with the hostel online weeks in advance. Turned up and was told I’d reserved a 4 bedroom dorm, which definitely wasn’t the case. I showed my confirmation and was told by the person on the desk even though i was right, there was nothing he could do about it (as apparently his system was more right) and that i’d have to pay the same price to stay in shared accommodation! I ended up taking it further to the manager, who then gave me one free nights stay in a 4 bed dorm but still charged me the private room rate for the second night! The manager promised to look into the issue of what happened but I never heard back on this.Don’t bother staying here. If you reserve a bed in a 12 bedroom dormitory they will probably downgrade you to sleep outside on the street. It’s in a good location and I did end up having two good room mates, but it certainly isn’t worth the stress borthering with this place as you don’t know how they can mess you around.

This place has a all night staff member that doesn't even know her way around the hostel never the less someone able to help control a drunk person physically attacking me in their lobby. The next day the lady who said she was the manager, Alana, went from pretending to be nice to freaking out and yelling... watch out for her... with that amount of sores on her face, she either has an disease or is using heavy drugs. God bless anyone trying to stay alive at this place.Do yourself a favor and pay for a hotel... these guys are way too expensive for how dangerous of a circus this experience was. and of course no refund",5-Oct-18,"7    USA Hostels San Francisco

403,"USA Hostels was an overall good experience. The facilities are good, personal light and socket on the beds is a brilliant idea. Charging points in the lockers is also very handy!They had plenty of free or cheap activities on each day although I only managed to do the pub crawl. Was good and met plenty of people on it.Location is good, a few blocks across from Union Square. About a 30-40 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf but up and down some huge notorious San Francisco hills.Only slight negative is the staff didn't know which public transport I could use to get to Fisherman's Wharf, I had to work this out for myself.I would recommend staying here and overall a positive experience.

Also book the airport shuttle, really affordable option to and from SFO.Cons: It's pricey, but not many good hostel options in SF so I guess it's expected.

The hostel never called the police, I went to the hospital because obviously I was under pain and my nose was bleeding and I had to pay 1000 usd to be attended in the hospital.

447,"Rooms 3/5 - 6 bed shared dorm. Clean, safe, basic. It is, what it is!Beds were clean and comfortable with access to lights and power sockets. The lockers were safe. Facilities 2.5/5 - Shared bathrooms. Clean-ish!Shared bathrooms were large, clean-ish and with hot water. Toilets were also clean and generally well stocked. Breakfast was self-service and pretty well stocked. The cleanliness depends on the guests there at the time.Service 3/5 - Nice and helpful staff at front desk (when you spoke with them). Location 5/5 - In the heart of SF. Near bars, restaurants and public transport.The hostel is down a questionable looking alleyway. However the alley itself is clean and safe. The location is great because you can take a nice stroll to virtually anywhere in the main city area or grab a bike/tram nearby for ease. Some may feel a little anxious due to the number of homeless people in the vicinity, but this is the hardship of the city due to recent evictions, and not the fault of the hostel. Let me be clear, the homeless there are non-threatening and the streets are safe.Overall 13.5/20 : Basic but convenient",15-Dec-17,"7    USA Hostels San Francisco

It is true that there are many homeless in the area but we never felt unsafe. The breakfast was good but the breakfast room, although large, was very crowded.

464,"Unfortunately USA hostels fell a little short of expectation for me & my partner given all the great reviews. The location is decent although a bit of a 15-20min walk uphill from the Powell St Bart Station with heavy luggage- we had friends stay at the Parc 55 hotel which was much more central and better value (in terms of cleanliness, proximity, sound proofing)- we really wished we had stayed there as we heard from my friends that Parc 55 was only a little bit more expensive than our private room. Upon arrival, check in service was fine and efficient. The lifts were much needed although lift doors a bit awkward to negotiate with heavy luggage (old building). We stayed on the 4th floor in a private double room with private bathroom. The room was very small, smelled of sewage and carried a lot of noise from downstairs when the window was open. We had to try and open the window for air as it was very hot even with a ceiling fan- however this meant that we had barely any sleep at night (from staff/residents/guests/neighbours- talking outside meant the noise carried up) or in the morning. We couldn't sleep until 12 am most nights and would be woken up at 6am by the noise of people (unsure if USA Hostel Staff) working downstairs. We had to shut the window one night in order to get any sleep. The bed linen was very rough and worn. Our one window also faced directly opposite someone else's room who was probably only 2-3 metres away in another building which interfered with privacy and and I needed to keep the curtains closed most of the time, but got very warm in the process).We had one episode where I was woken up and kept up from 11.30pm-1am in the morning due to the next door guest/neighbour playing very loud music, being very drunk and loud with banging and crashing that made me very concerned. I actually had to call the front desk at 12.15am as I was too afraid to go outside of my room to report it downstairs- it sounded as if the people next door were high on drugs with a mix of alcohol and I was wary of how they would respond in an inebriated state if I were to ask them to keep the noise down. Unfortunately the Front desk staff reported that they were unable to do anything as they were the only staff on duty but said that they would pass it on to the next staff member. When I reported the incident in the morning, this information had not passed it on. However, the staff member who I reported it to later said that he would deal with the matter.",29-Sep-17,"7    USA Hostels San Francisco

The hostel is very big so people are going and coming all the time, but it was still relativly quiet in the rooms which was good. The breakfasts are included and are nice - as long as you aren't gluten free which would definitely be a problem! The staff are helpful and personable, although I did get the impression that they are used to a younger crowd (I am 36) and so they did not suggest any of the events they organise, although they did recommend them to younger travellers, which seemed a bit strange. The hostel is well kept and clean and the dorms were fine (I stayed in 3 during my period there).

The hotel is located in a good area there are plenty of things close by with a convenience store a couple of doors away and a nice coffee place also a pizza delivery across the street. The hotel is a short walk of about 10 minutes to Union Square and shopping and also the start of one of the street car routes to Fisherman’s Wharf. Also if you are using the hop on/off bus the nearest stop is less than 10 minutes away.The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel clean and tidy.

First used as a speakeasy during prohibition with an underground entrance in the 1920s, the venue took the (Plush Room) Cabaret Theatre name in 1926. It was located in what was then the Empire Hotel. While the plush room is no more today, there is a side-entrance door off the main lobby to remind you of what was once a wonderful experience to San Francisco’s past. Not only were all the people who worked here very nice, but also very helpful with any needs or questions. -They made us feel very comfortable. Our room was small but very comfortable and met all our expectations to include a very comfortable rain-shower feature which was great after a long day of walking. This hotel is one not to miss, and sure to please any history-buff. Don’t miss out. These types of Hotels won’t be around forever.",26-Feb-19,"8    Hotel Vertigo

494,"Disappointed. The website states 'begin each morning with coffee & tea service hosted daily in our lobby'. There is the skeleton of a cafe but when I asked about it I was told it doesn't open any more - no explanation, no apology.'Complimentary morning newspaper' never appeared.'Business center in the lobby' is one PC, printer and chair.I made a point of emailing before I visited to ask if cards for deposit payments are just authorised or if payment would actually be taken then refunded - they confirmed payment wouldn't be taken but when I checked out, big shocker, the funds had been taken from my card so I'm now waiting for the refund.My room was clean and the size I expected but not the standard - see pics for unsightly wiring/trunking and an exposed threshold into the walk in wardrobe/safe area which is pretty painful to step on/stub your toe on.Dark lower wall and carpet colours make it feel dingy and dull. The heating system is awful - unit build into the wall which can be set on 'fan' or 'heat' ... and there's no middle ground for either so the room was cold and then after 10mins set on 'heat' it's stifling. Only 2 or 3 of the channels on the TV consistently received signal, the others repeatedly dropped out. Don't know if you'd class it as a motel but it's definitely not a hotel.Location wise if you're a tourist I'd recommend being in the Fisherman's Wharf area instead (unless your budget allows for a Union Square hotel)",14-Feb-19,"8    Hotel Vertigo

My friend and I were met by Christina at reception. Warm and welcoming. Which is great after an 11 hour flight. Smooth and easy check in. Great recommendations for food in the local area and given a map for directions around the city. We chose to upgrade to a 2 bed room. Great facilities in room. Coffee, tea, shower over bath, fabulous quality of toiletries. The shampoo is amazing.safe and ironing facilities. Water is $2 a bottle but that's the average price for a 500 ml bottle. After the jet lag kicked we were wide awake so stepped outside for some fresh air at 02.30 am. Welcomed back into the hotel by Sam the lovely night desk watchman. As our next flight changed schedules once again reception staff Christina and Cynthya service shone through and assisted us with shuttle bus bookings and recommendations for things to do whilst we have a few hours left in San Francisco. The housekeeping teams have kept our room nice and clean and topted up with refreshments and toiletries.So our stay has been even more brilliant, as the hotel has felt like a home from home. With there excellent service with that added human touch which has made all the difference. I will happily stay here again and will recommend this hotel to anyone.

The history and nostalgia of the hotel prompted me to make a reservation. Wasn't sure what to expect having flown 14 hours from New Zealand to San Fransico. When I had arrived I was greeted by a friendly staff who made my check-in seamless. The room was small but adequate for my 4-day stay. You could feel the history oozing out of the walls from when the hotel first made its debut in the 1958 Alfred Hitchcock movie, 'Vertigo'. The hotel was perfectly located in the heart of San Fransico making it easy to get to restaurants, stores and attractions. The highlight for me was walking down to the fish market at Fishermen's Wharf and enjoying the freshly caught seafood and a glass of wine.

But the room that we were put in to start off with was pretty awful. It was on the ground floor and whilst decorated nicely, the bathroom was very strange and the 'view' was of the fire escape! I couldn't reach the floor whilst sitting on the toilet, I'm not a short person but I thought this was quite strange. So we asked to change rooms and the friendly lady at reception said yes of course but not now. So we asked when we came back, only to be told we needed to ask in the morning! We asked again in the morning and eventually got moved to a much better room - with some daylight as a starting bonus. It wasn't an upgrade and from what they said at reception they had spare rooms, I can't imagine why you'd put anyone in our first room when there was another room free but hey ho. On the whole our stay was good but I felt a little disappointed with being crammed in the basement at the start.

All ideal for us as we were out from 8am everyday not returning before 8pm. If you wanted to spend any length of time in the room it’s probably not for you.

The rooms were a good size and functional with the same colour scheme as the rest of the place. The staff were very helpful and sorted us out with places to eat and transfer to the airport.

If its a five star hotel your looking for the Willows makes no claim to be so but there is five star service. There are a few things the guest needs to know before considering booking and I want to be honest with readers. The city of San Francisco has had for many years a large homeless problem which is visible in this neighbourhood. Some guests may find this off putting. It’s a fact of life in this city and not confined to areas around the bed and breakfast. The Willows has shared bathroom/shower toilet facilities. There are no en suites. These facilities are spotless.The business is well managed. There is a nice lounge sitting area and also breakfast buffet is laid out in the kitchen in the morning. I love this place.

Lively Castro District location; cozy, clean, safe and comfortable home base for my girlfriends-from-around-the-world reunion. Can't say enough about owner Mike and his friendly staff being so helpful and kind during our week's stay. Very reasonable prices on the 12-room accommodations in this refurbished mansion, with lovely antiques and mini fridges in each room.  Transportation, many ethnic restaurants, atmospheric taverns, Whole Foods, and even a 24-hr Safeway are within short blocks of the Willows Inn front door.  Our favorite group excursion over the last weekend in October was to get tix for a 2-day plus 1-night Hop-On Hop-Off Big Bus tour, which has 20 stops all over the city, and a live guided tour translated by earphones into 10 languages. Make sure to hop off in Haight-Asbury to walk the beautiful, historic main street filled with interesting shops, and hop off at Golden Gate Park to visit the Science Center, Imax, plus Aquarium for one price. And you can't miss Fisherman's Wharf to hear the sea lions argue and play with each other while you sample seafood.  Then, what a treat to retreat to our separate rooms back at the Willows, and convene in the Library/Sitting Room for our own happy hour before deciding on a dinner restaurant nearby. Our favorite was the very popular, delicious Spanish restaurant Picada down the street.

We did not have time to try the breakfast but previous reviews have raved about it. The B&B is in the Castro area and convenient for enjoying the area or taking public transit to other areas of the city. I rated the place a 4 because parking is difficult.

530,"I stayed at this place during the July long weekend and beyond. When I booked, the owners sent me an e-mail with the directions to the inn from SF Airport. I followed the directions to the T, and had no problem finding the place. It takes almost 30-45 minutes in train/subway to reach from SF international airport to this place. Just make sure to have enough USD in cash with you, as the machines at the stations are not very friendly with credit/debit cards. (In fact, there is a man that makes money from tips by helping visitors on how to operate the machine)The location is very close the Church Street subway, plus you can take the bus/streetcar from the street to access SF downtown. I was given a room at the second floor. The room was clean, with fresh sheets on the bed, a table, drawers, a cupboard , a small TV and a basin with toiletries. The Wi-Fi speed is adequate.The staff was very friendly and helped me with directions to nearby restaurants and attractions. There are a number of restaurants within walking distance of this place. There is also a Safeway opposite this place. So finding a place to eat is not a problem, even if you happen to be a vegetarian (I am one).The place serves breakfast every morning. Yogurt with all the helpings of dry-fruit, all kinds of bread with spreads (I had my first taste of vegemite), cereals, cheese, boiled eggs, juice-coffee-tea and a freshly baked treat every morning (Although after a while it could get repetitive). I wish they included more savoury treats in the morning, but I know American breakfast doesn't include savoury/salty items.The washrooms and bathrooms were clean. No complaints there. I liked the request card about not wasting the water.The payment was upfront when I checked in. I found it bit odd, but on hindsight, I was in hurry when I was leaving and the payment process would have just delayed my departure. So don't regret having an upfront payment.During my stay, I saw people from all demographics. This place does not serve to just specific clienteles.Overall, I enjoyed my stay at this place.The reasons why I didn't give a 5 rating to the property1) This is an old house converted into a residence. So if you are carrying luggage with you, you are on your own when it comes to carrying luggage to your room. I have a bad back and wasn't happy carrying my bag to the room.2) The house is old and has that old carpet smell.3) There are no central or window AC. So either you keep the window open at night or use fan. Luckily, it didn't get very warm at night when I was staying. Opening window at night invites street noise.4) There are some shady characters loitering near this place during night. I am not sure if there is any care taker during night and the possibility of trespassing. (Yes - I am being a bit paranoid here)5) They gave me a key form the main entrance and the room. In case you lose your key and you come home late at night, I am not sure what would be your options.6) The washrooms were clean and had a hand sanitizer, but having to walk to your room to wash your hands just seemed a bit odd.",19-Aug-17,"9    The Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn

The rooms are spacious and clean, restrooms and bathrooms in the common spaces are not a problem at all. Priceless the square chocolate you find in your room when you arrive.

535,"It was a delight to check in here for the 3rd time within two years.Handy to lots of local public transport and within walking distance of the centre of Castro, the Willows Inn nevertheless provides a quiet and cozy home away from home. The rooms are charming and very comfortable, and there is also a lovely living room in which we can read, watch TV, watch a movie or chat with others.Please do not worry about the shared showers and toilets, as they are close to all rooms, and they are immaculately serviced, cleaned and maintained at all times.There is plenty of information available about the specifically GLBT attractions of San Francsico, as well as about all the many other fascinations of this amazing city.The breakfast room is small and friendly, and the cold buffet selection is excellent - breads & muffins with toaster, spreads, fruit, cereals, yoghurts, beverages. And for the Australians, they have Vegemite available!Above all, our hosts welcome us with very friendly courtesy, really valuing our patronage, and making guests feel at home over and over again, and being eager to help whenever they can.The F-tram, operating from Castro through Downtown and to Fisherman's Wharf, leaves from across the road, whilst MUNI trams and buses are also just across the road.

540,"We stayed here for 3 nights and it was amazing. Between the comfortable rooms, the friendly staff, the great location, and the reasonable price, I cannot say enough great things about the Willows. The staff were friendly and helpful, always ready with a suggestion on where to go or what to do. Their dining recommendations were always on point. Different people had different styles (some pointed us to their book of restaurants in the area, others suggested their favorite places to eat. They joined us for the wine hour in the library, which was a wonderful and relaxing way to get to know them better. Breakfast had a lot of options for us, which was good. The kitchen was a bit cozy, but we were always able to get in to get food without a problem. One morning we decided to eat in our room, just because of the space concerns in there.The rooms were clean and our room was quite big. We had gotten one of the larger rooms in the place, and the space was good for us. We did get to peek in some of the other rooms, and while they were smaller, they were not unreasonably so. The bathrooms were always clean, the showers were wiped down in between uses. We had a sink in our room, which was nice to cut down on lines to use the bathroom to brush teeth. You cannot beat the location. Right in the center of the city, with easy access to all forms of public transit available in the city. Most of it was right outside the door, and the BART was just a short walk away. And we're still blown away at the price. We had looked at hotel prices in the city and didn't think we'd be able to afford a trip to San Francisco, but then we found this place and it was like a dream come true.We absolutely will stay here for all of our future trips to San Francisco.

541,"Very well located in San Francisco, near to bus stop and underground station, the Willows Inn is a quiet place to stay next to Castro and Mission. Several restaurants are nearby and it's not too far from SFO international. The bed and breakfast has very charming rooms, wide and clear, but not all of them. I stayed in a family room which was a little bit narrow for three and less confortable than other rooms I saw. The room was not very clear, we had a view on bins, but very quiet; the closet too was too small for three travelling with big suitcases. The strong points: the b&b has bathrooms and showers to share but everything works perfectly and it is very clean. Breakfast is very convivial in the kitchen and rich.

Staff were professional and helpful.Great location, less than 1 min walking distance from Church station, and good eats around the area. A downside to road-facing rooms is the noise level at night, which is contributed by frequent muni metro/rapid transits, and bar clients from the 2 adjacent bars, the latter of which dies down by 2+am.

545,"We stayed in the Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn for a total of 11 days (a weekend away over the period) in April-May 2016. It suited us perfectly. We loved the conviviality of chatting with other guests over breakfast (great variety - lots of fruit, cereals, pastries, breads, yoghurts, etc), and, when we could, relaxing with our hosts and other guests over a glass of wine (or beer) in the sitting room / library before going out to dinner in the evenings. Willows is located in the vibrant Mission / Castro district, and a few dozen metres from excellent buses, trams and metro - very easy to go down town or elsewhere in the city, or to the BART, CalTrain or highways to head out of town. We stayed in room 32 for our longer period - on the top floor, beautifully decorated and spacious with a bay window facing south, so lovely and sunny in spring while we were there. Double glazing helps keep street noise down if windows are closed, and windows can be opened for cooling breezes. The WCs and showers are separate from the rooms, with two of each on each floor and are not a great difficulty (at least while we were there over a relatively quiet period) - robes provided for each guest and there is a basin in each room, and toiletries provided. This means the room price is relatively low for the quality of the rooms, service, convivial atmosphere and the location in this expensive city!

547,"What a great B&B! We always try to stay in a B&B on our travels because they provide the most personable experiences. We were a little apprehensive about The Willows because the nightly rate for our room was so much less than we expected, and they only asked us to pay for the first night when we made our reservations. In a city like San Francisco, we expected much higher room rates and to be charged in total up front. Just the beginning of a great visit! I just have to mention that what really makes this place SPECIAL are all of the little touches such as robes in the room, small baskets filled with shower essentials including a shower cap to take to the shower, oversize towels, room service daily if desired.We made these reservations in May 2015 for our visit the last of Feb and early Mar 2016. We were first attending a ""Destination Wedding"" in Cancun Mexico and decided to fly on to San Francisco from there for a few days. We had never been to S.F. before, so this was our first experience. We absolutely loved it and our four days there.The Willows Inn is sort of hidden between two businesses with only a sign and a door with a bell to ring. Once buzzed in, we were greeted by one of the four guys (Michael, JoJo, Mark, & Gary) who operate the Inn. We were faced by a long flight of stairs up to the next level where the B&B was. Seeing those stairs made my heart sink because I knew I could not possibly carry my bags up those stairs (I am 70 and have had two heart surgeries). Thank goodness the wonderful man who greeted us took our bags and bounded up the stairs. Our room was actually on the next level (LOL!), but it was not yet ready. We checked in and took the innkeeper's suggestion that we go get a bite to eat first. He gave wonderful directions and recommended a great place for lunch. Upon returning to the B&B, we found that he had moved all of our belongings upstairs to our room, and he gave us a tour of the full place.There are so many things I want to mention about this great place! First, the location is perfect. It is ideally situated with easy access to the underground trains and to the surface transportation. We loved riding the ""F"" streetcar line to the Embarcadero and Fisherman's Wharf and then the opposite direction to Castro Street. History was just everywhere!Free WiFi was excellent. Our room was cozy and very clean with a queen bed, tv, minifridge, and a wash basin in the room. All rooms shared shower rooms and water closets that were very clean and private with four of each on both floors. There is an expanded continental breakfast each morning in the breakfast room with a wide variety of foods and a local newspaper. The breakfast room is available to guests 24 hours a day. Early each evening an innkeeper serves complimentary cocktails in the sitting room. We only took advantage of this once because we were always on the go, but it is a very nice touch. One of the highlights of our stay was meeting other guests for breakfast and chatting with them and the innkeepers.We cannot wait to return to San Francisco, and you can bet we will be at The Willows!",20-Mar-16,"9    The Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn

We found the Willows on line and booked two rooms (none have private baths but there are plenty and super well cared for. Showers and toilet rooms are separate and rooms have skinks). It was only later while further reviewing the website that I discovered that I had been their with my husband and other family members also 40 years before. The place was much the same (it is not at all handicapped accessible and it is a steep stair case up. Even at my 70 some years, it was not that daunting). The place is filled with books and books. The staff is super helpful but that there at night. We enjoyed complimentary wine in the library one night and that was very nice. Right next door, by the way, if a Vietnamese restaurant (we French when we were there before) and it is well worth eating there. Another plus - transportation is just down and up and street.

The place is very affordable, and the area is a nice change from the crowded downtown Union Square hotels.I stayed in a two-room suite with another couple. In retrospect, I would have preferred to book two separate rooms, because I had to pass through their room in order to use the bathroom and shower down the hall. The two-room suite would be perfect for family members, but it was a little tight for two couples.That said, the place was very clean, and I never had to wait to use the bathroom or shower rooms. Each bathroom and shower was private and clean. During office hours, I noticed that a staff member went in to each shower after its use and made sure to freshen the room. Nice touch.The continental breakfast was also nice, although the room could be a little crowded. The place was very quiet, as well. My only small gripe was that the pillows on the bed were flat as a pancake. I'd advise them to get new pillows soon! Otherwise, I highly recommend the Willows if you don't mind the shared bathrooms situation and a steep stairway to the guest rooms. NOTE: I'd request a third floor room next time, because the bathrooms upstairs are much brighter because of the skylights.",30-Jul-15,"9    The Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn

Normaly i prefer more modern places but in this victorian building it all fits very well. All staff i extremly friendly and professional. Allways some good advice... restaurants...places to go etc. Breakfast is served in a little kitchen with a ""join me table"" Every more you can meet fresh fruit, cereals and very nice and interesting people.

We were received very friendly, our room with two beds was conveniently sized and adequately equipped (but only had a rather small window on an alley, where there can be some noise at night). The beds were very comfortable. Everyhing is meticulously clean and the people there are very helpful. Bathroom facilities are shared. Although that never caused an issue (keeping in mind that the inn did not seem to be very busy at the time), that is the only thing I did not like about the place.

566,"The Willows is a friendly, clean and homely B&B. From the outside it looks small, but looks can be deceiving as inside this is a large two storey dwelling. Staff are friendly and on hand should you require anything. Bathroom facilities are shared, but this was never a problem for us, so you shouldn't worry about this. Continental Breakfast was plentiful and had a nice selection of fruits, cereals, yogurts and breads. Likewise Tea, Coffee, Milk and Juices are all provided, and they even wash the dishes for you. The only problem we encountered was with noise at the rear of the property where our room was based. We booked the 2 bedroom suite and this room sits next to a large fan from the restaurant below the B&B. The droning of the fan/exhaust stopped me getting an early night on the first night we arrived. The fan eventually gets switched off around 11pm. So if you're noise sensitive, I would avoid this room, which is a shame because it's a great room otherwise. Overall we had a great stay and would definitely return. However we would choose another room away from the restaurant below. ",8-Jan-15,"9    The Willows Bed and Breakfast Inn

We had no problem getting around. The Inn is perfectly situated so that you can get anywhere reasonably fast. We found an amazing breakfast spot around the corner (Duboce Park Cafe) and were right next door to Safeway where we could buy lunch for our day trips.

Conveniently situated just off Market Street with easy access to Metro and street car transport and in an area packed with cafes and a nearby branch of Wholefoods, this was a great find. I stayed on what the Americans call the 3rd floor (2nd for us Brits) and my room (like the place In general) was cosily furnished, a trifle old fashioned perhaps, but a pleasure to stay in. The wifi works, the communal kitchen/breakfast room is stocked with juices, fruit, yogurt and teas ideal for a late night return if you are peckish - lovely. There are books on the landings and in the sitting room which is a nice touch in these gadget obsessed days. Very tasteful indeed. The cocktail hour between 6 and 7pm is a great way to meet other guests, though my busy sightseeing schedule meant that I only got to it 2 or 3 times during the week. Friendly and helpful hosts too.

We stayed twice in SF, once without a car and once with so this property is ideal for those needing a car spot.

There's a great pizza place and a supermarket just next door and the Presidio is a lovely place to walk.Now to the ""be aware"" point. I am not used to lodging places that are so dog friendly, we had three in a row in our stay. This is not the norm in Australia and I am not keen. The room next door had two very large dogs, one a German Shepherd and one something else. One barked some time after 10pm when it wanted to go out. It did the same thing at 4am. It didn't bark for long but then in a small place it only takes one or two barks to wake everyone around it up. It did about 4 or 5 before its owner managed to quiet it -4 or 5 barks are very loud in the room next door at 4am.

599,"I recently stayed in this hotel with 6 friends and the Travelodge was perfect for us. Here’s why.Price: I wanted to stay in San Fran at an affordable price and this fit the bill. I wanted to be in the city for easier accessibility but not pay hundreds a night.Location: Perfect! I loved the location as this hotel is within walking distance of beautiful beach views of the Golden Gate Bridge, along a great walking path. In fact one day we walked down to the Golden Gate Bridge and walked the entire length of it! The hotel is also in a nice, safe area where we felt comfortable walking around. There was also quick access to a grocery store, Walgreens, bars, and restaurants all within walking distance so you did not need a car or Uber.Parking: First come, first serve free parking was awesome because we did have a car that was necessary for some activities on our trip and rides to/from the airport. We did not have a problem getting a spot as we came and went. The free parking appealed to me as I did not want to incur any extra costs on top of the hotel per night cost.Staff: Absolutely wonderful, helpful, pleasant. Raymond the manager was fantastic for city recommendations. He knew his stuff about the city and genuinely enjoyed sharing his knowledge and helping you out and plan your day. We also had multiple rooms for a few nights and the staff was great to accommodate different people coming/going at different times, charging different credit cards, putting rooms near each other, etc.Room: The room was very basic accommodations, clean and comfortable. Don’t expect luxury, but you’ll have everything you need for a good night’s sleep. Some rooms seemed a bit smaller than others so space was a little tight, but we were literally using the rooms just to sleep so it was exactly what we needed.Breakfast: Having a small selection of breakfast goodies with coffee each morning was a nice bonus to rely on each morning before we headed out.Overall, I think this is a great hotel for the value we paid. While not the fanciest hotel, it’s a great budget option with a few hidden amentities that really made it worth it for me and my friends.",15-Nov-18,"10    Travelodge by Wyndham Presidio San Francisco

We were quickly settled in. The next morning when we went down to breakfast their was a manager there that was extremely helpful answering questions and even took us in to an office and outlined a route we needed for later in the day getting back to the hotel. The staff also allowed us access to a microwave later in the evening to warm up some food. In the afternoon they had hot chocolate and cookies available. Much appreciated! The hotel itself was very basic and a place to sleep which was all we were looking for. There is a deli and pizza place just down the block. We also were able to walk to a Walgreens that was several blocks away. The neighborhood seemed fairly safe, although there was loud voices outside our room one night. We later learned someone had wondered onto the property and the police had to be called because they were knocking on doors and wouldn't leave. We did feel safe while we were there.

The Travelodge is located a little bit away from Fisherman’s Wharf however is about an hour walk to the Golden Gate Bridge. The parking lot is relatively small and you are not guaranteed a space in the lot as there are more rooms than spaces. However, upon arrival, a staff member rushed out to make sure we could find a parking spot. If there are no spots in the lot, they help you park on the street which is free. The outside isn’t much to look at (as another reviewer put it) but don’t let that fool you. Once you’re in the room, it’s clean, spacious and great for a night stay in San Fransisco.

618,"Oh, where do I start? I was literally impressed from check-in to check-out. I’m a person who is very big on customer service. This hotel staff from the front desk to maintenance/housekeeping knocked it out of the park!! When I was planning my San Francisco trip, I was blown away by the cost of a lot of the hotels. Typically, I stay at hotels within the Hilton network when I’m on an extended vacation and hotels that fall within the Wyndham network for one night stays. I didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a hotel because I planned to spend money elsewhere so I decided on this hotel because of the online reviews and the fact that parking was free unlike many of the other hotels. Our flight arrived way ahead of the check-in time (9:15 AM) to be exact BUT the staff was willing to accommodate us with an early check-in. My husband was given recommendations on where to eat and he even got a map of San Francisco that outlined the location of various attractions. Again, customer service was nothing like I had ever experienced at my usual 4 star hotels. I tip my hat off to the management here because it is apparent that EXCEPTIONAL customer service is a requirement at this establishment. For example, I left my suitcase by the stairs and I think the guy was the manager, he brought the suitcase up the stairs and to my room door. I thought that was so nice of him because he probably saw that I needed help and he jumped right in to help. So, this is my honest review of this hotel and keep in mind that I am hard to please. 1st, customer service is EXCEPTIONAL. 2nd, the location is within a 2-4 mile radius of everything that you may want to do in San Francisco. 3rd, parking is free but the parking spots are limited (TIP: Park your car after check-out and use Lyft/Uber/BART to get where you want to go it’s not expensive. That’s what we did for some stuff. On the other hand, you can avoid a car all together.) 4th, BART runs right in front of the hotel. 5th, this hotel is NOT rundown as stated by the person in the previous post. This is coming from a picky person. It has that old San Francisco charm like a lot of the other buildings in San Francisco. 6th, the hotel is located in a safe area. 7th, the hotel has a good continental breakfast, 8th, the rooms are nice, clean, and spacious. They also have a nice size fridge and a microwave. The beds are very, very comfy. I definitely will stay here again on my return visit. The service that I received here surpassed any service that I have received at a Hilton. Please don’t be deterred by the fact that it’s a Travelodge and rated a 2 Star because it does not paint a true picture of the quality of this hotel. Lastly, if you are staying at the Travelodge like I, chances are the other hotels were out of your price range so don’t get on here trying to bash this hotel when you know that this was all that you could afford. Your hopes shouldn’t be as high knowing that this is a 2 Star hotel. I personally didn’t know what to expect but I was on a budget and I didn’t want to break the bank. However, it worked out perfectly for me because it surpassed my expectations. ",6-Apr-18,"10    Travelodge by Wyndham Presidio San Francisco

The room was fine with a comfortable bed and excellent linen. But it was the people who made it for us. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful and we met some fascinating fellow guests at the wine social each evening with nibbles and bottles of local red and white to sample. There's a tram stop at the bottom of the road and - once you master the public transportation system - it's not difficult to get downtown and to the parks and museums. Two minor quibbles. The quality of the breakfast and wine social nibbles seemed to depend on who was on duty. One morning's buffet breakfast featured a very poor selection compared to the usual big bowl of fresh fruit, bagels, muffins, toast, yoghurt and very decent coffee.

641,"My husband and I enjoyed 2 great nights. I have read some of the previous reviews regarding the room and the reception (friendliness) during their stay. Yes the corner room may be a bit noisier - but it is the city, and a city that is well known to have trolleys and other traffic that is noisy. Personally I think it is not unexpected to have noise. A recommendation is to either bring ear plugs (they are cheap to buy reusable ones) for staying in cities or other multi-use places (like hostels, Airbnb, hotels, etc) - or have available at the front desk for individuals requiring them. I did not have an issue with the noise. The bed was very comfortable. We were also very impressed with breakfast options: there was a wonderful selection of choices including fresh fruit, cereals, yogurt, hot porridge, coffee and other options. I was quite pleased with this, as I had not expected this wide of selection and had not mentioned a dietary restriction of no gluten. The fresh fruit, yogurt and coffee were great for me. Staff was friendly. All areas were well cared for and clean. The outdoor area was beautiful and well cared for as well. As far as heterosexuals not feeling welcome - this surprises me. We felt very welcome and comfortable there. We were sad that they didn't have availability for an additional night! We decided at the last minute to stay another night in San Francisco and it unfortunately didn't work out to stay another night. The place was quite interesting and beautiful, with all the woodwork that was well maintained.",29-Mar-19,"11    Parker Guest House

Firstly, it has a great location, being just a few minutes walk from the Castro area with great Cafes, restaurants and funky shops and bars. I've always felt it is a safe area to walk around and the area has a great atmosphere. Secondly, while the Parker is not located in the middle of downtown, it is only a short trip downtown, and I'd rather have the better location and atmosphere! There is a Muni stop right at the door, several lines run to the Castro, there is the heritage trolley car, as well as buses and Ubers. And it's only a 15 minute level walk to the Bart station if you want to take the train to SFO. And most importantly, staying at the Parker really feels like a home away from home. The rooms are very clean and comfortable and the living room areas are really nice to sit and read or work, especially in front of the open fire in winter! The breakfast room is filled with light and I've met some amazing people to talk to over breakfast. After a long day in the city, it really does feel like coming home. And the staff are just amazing.

The grounds are nice and on nice days you can have a relaxing afternoon or evening. The staff here is friendly and if you need anything they try to help you. Wine is served from 5:30-6:30 each evening and offers a nice opportunity to meet fellow guests and travelers. We met several nice couples each night. In the lobby sitting room a decanter of brandy is always available and provides a wonderful opportunity to meet people. We have come down each night and have met some very nice people and enjoyed the evenings. I can't say anything wrong about the guesthouse. I can't say enough about this place, trams are out the door and a block away or if you want another one it is 5 blocks easy walk. Restaurants are all around again within just a few blocks. Again I found this to be a real gem. I have seen the reviews and met the people who stay here and many have been coming here and staying for years. I think that in its self says a lot.

667,"Fantastic little hotel in a perfect location in San Francisco. Their pre-visit communication was great. I read that there were two buildings so I requested that our daughter's room was close to ours and when we arrived she was just across the hall from us. The rooms are very nicely furnished. There are two buildings - originally two neighbouring residential homes - which share a lovely patio garden. They are very organised and had very good systems in place with very nice touches such as fresh brew coffee in the second house's kitchen if residents there didn't want to go across to the breakfast room. The breakfast was great - 'continental' but definitely sufficient, with plentiful baked goods, fresh juice and fruit, oatmeal and yogurt and coffee and tea of course. It didn't bother us but the only drawback I could envisage for anyone considering booking would be the number of stairs; there are quite a few up and down between the houses and accessing the main building. The staff are absolutely lovely and will assist with luggage etc but it's not ideal if you have any real mobility issues. The location of this place is also great; you can get on and off the yellow J line from just up the road on Church Street and the J line takes you into the main centre of town and access to all other lines so we bought a 3-day clipper card from Walgreens and went everywhere by tram. It's also only about a 10 minute walk from The Castro area and we also walked from here to Mission, which was a bit further but not too bad. The ubers are also very reliable and cheap here though. Overall this was a great choice and a perfect end to a great vacation. And we will definitely stay here again if we go back to SF.",12-Oct-18,"11    Parker Guest House

670,"It was our first trip to California and it began with four nights in San Francisco at the The Parker Guest House, before heading on down the coast. We wanted to stay in a location with more of a feel for the real San Francisco and not just the touristy side. The Parker Guest House was perfect. Within walking distance of Castro and Mission District with many shops and restaurants and so close to Market Street. The staff greeted us and showed us around the property and to our room. I would like to say that we felt the staff were very professional, friendly and made you feel comfortable from the minute you met them. Our room was in the building adjacent to the main house. After reading some reviews about noise along the street, I specifically asked for a room in the back when I made our reservation. We had Room 40 on the 3rd or 4th floor (depending on which door you entered from) with private bath in the back section of the building and it was perfectly quite. The room was a bit small but it accommodated us fine. Ample space in the bathroom and it was very clean. No elevator so be prepared to walk up stairs. The cleaning staff always did an exceptional job of keeping the room neat and tidy. The bed was very comfortable with quality linens and pillows. There was a small kitchen area in the front of our building where you could make coffee or tea. It had a refrigerator and we left an unopened bottle of champagne in it for a couple of days and no one bothered it. We walked over to the main house for breakfast in the mornings and a couple of afternoons we stopped in for the wine and cheese social. It was nice meeting and talking to people from different countries and states. And the outside grounds were great. With the private gazebo, fruit trees and fountain. They had private parking for our car (which was a little tight) but very secure. The hotel was completely secure. You had to have a key to enter the grounds/property. We enjoyed the city (except for the crazy drivers) and we opted to take Uber for the most part. We walked around the neighborhood and really enjoyed the feel of the area. Be sure to check out the Clarion Alley Mural Project. It was fantastic! We drove ourselves around exploring the city one day and drove over to Muir Woods, Stinson Beach and Sausalito another day, but you should get familiar with their traffic laws first! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here would definitely choose The Parker Guest House again on our next visit.",16-Sep-18,"11    Parker Guest House

671,"We stayed at Parker Guest House with our two daughters at the start of our mini-tour in California. We arrived from the U.K. after a long flight but right from the outset we were made to feel right at home. That for us was the best thing about our stay; the hospitality. It was faultless. That’s not to say there was anything wrong with its location; in fact that was ideal too; right on the J Line and only a few blocks from BART and the historic streetcars on the F Line. It was lovely to escape the crowds and live like a local. No shortage of places to eat and drink locally either. That said, after the amazing breakfast of fresh fruits, yoghurts, pastries, bagels etc it was a while before we needed anything! At the other end of the day, the wine social was a great way to start the evening.The main guest house building where we stayed is a 1907 building with plenty of features and character. The only slightly adverse comment I would make about our stay is that in our downstairs rooms (20 and 21) we heard footsteps from the public lounge area above at around 5am which seemed a bit early. That said, this is still absolutely a 5* establishment and this was only a very minor thing.We look forward to having an opportunity to return to Parker Guest House.",8-Sep-18,"11    Parker Guest House

672,"Greetings! Our son recently moved to San Francisco.This was our first visit and we wanted to stay near his apartment. Although this is billed as a guest house, I would consider it more like a boutique hotel.We were bummed when he moved from NY city,as there were so many cool hotels in the area. But we found a gem in San Fran! The Parker guest house probably has around 30 rooms. The home is beautiful as are the rooms. We stayed in 2 separate rooms,neither in the main building,and they were both clean,nicely appointed,with up-scale toiletries,water pitcher and chocolate.They were also able to accommodate our daughter with a rollaway bed. There is a lovely wine hour in the evening with snacks, and breakfast is provided. There seemed to always be coffee and sweets available in the kitchen.We loved all the areas to relax.... the beautiful den with fire place and brandy available,all the cute little sitting areas outside! I believe I sipped coffee or wine in every outdoor space!! You must see the beautifully landscaped back yard to believe it! Being from Baltimore, I was amazed by the lemon and apple trees! Having traveled all over the world, and being a self proclaimed"" hotel snob"", This property can hold its own against any luxury hotel. What stood out the most was the staff!! Kind without being phony,professional without being too formal or stuffy. They were always ready to chat,answer any questions ,and help in any way possible. Scot was the best,as was the young gentleman who worked during the day and the lady at the front desk( I'm sorry I don't remember their names)!!

674,"This was our third visit to this brilliantly located guesthouse and we were disappointed. Previously we have stayed in the main house in two different, lovely rooms. Both rooms had a decent amount of space and were really nice places to be. This time, however, we were housed in the second building across the garden and our room (Room 35) was extremely small. To move around the bed we had to negotiate past our suitcases as there was no way to put them out of the way. There was not even room for a solitary chair. The bathroom was a good size and was fine. Perhaps we had been given complimentary upgrades on our previous visits but we presumed that all their rooms were of that standard. We would not have paid the high price to stay in the little room we were given had we realised that the Parker Guesthouse had rooms like that. The bath was not clean when we arrived and did not appear to be cleaned during our four day stay. Getting out of the bath with other people’s long hairs clinging to your body is not good. The wine social was fun and is a generous addition to a stay at this place. The continental breakfast offers a lovely selection of pastries, bagels, toast, eggs, cereals and yoghurts. Very good. This guesthouse is perfectly located as the J line is just outside and The Castro is a short stroll up the road. The staff is friendly, the garden pretty and the building is gorgeous. Our two previous visits made this one of our favourite places in the world to stay. This time, however, was a disappointment on a number of levels. We will probably look for an alternative when we visit this great neighbourhood next year as we don’t want to pay $250+ per night for a room that is too small to be comfortable.",30-Aug-18,"11    Parker Guest House

We booked the King Deluxe Room was clean and good sized, no air con and we had to prop a window open with a book to get some air circulating. Staff were great and extremely welcoming and helpful with local knowledge and advice. Garden area was very nice to relax in. Negatives - trams pass by and can be quite loud, if your a light sleeper bring ear plugs. Breakfast - simple but basic, if your staying more than two / three days would be a bit repetitive.

Staff was engaging and helpful, rooms were immaculate and location was just ideal for me. I was visiting a new granddaughter and it was a nice walk to where I had to go. My only issue is that it would have been ideal if they had a mini-fridge and coffeemaker in case one wanted a late night glass of wine , yes, coffee or soft drink—- or needed to store meds that need refrigeration.

Not sure if I was imagining this though as that would be a shame. Didn’t see a pride flag - but I could have missed it. Great to see the guest house is so popular among travelers.

The 1970s ('80s?) concrete exterior did not prepare us for the large, beautiful (and recently updated) room. Staff were welcoming and helpful at every point. As timeshare owners with another organization, we found a number of things that exceeded what we get with our membership (e.g., daily maid service and evening events in the club lounge).

Rooms have been updated since then, and we had a fairly large, comfortable room on the 7th floor, (king sized bed, pull out sofa, desk, chairs, small mini kitchen area, and nice sized bathroom). Bed was comfortable and plenty of space to unpack, (large closet area w/ shelf space), for our week long stay. Plenty of counter space in bathroom, and fully stocked w/ towels. Water pressure was a bit weak at times, but nothing to complain about. Wifi was free and no problem w/ connecting, (although we did have to put in the password everyday). Never a wait for elevators, and staff was friendly. Only downside was how long it took the Wyndham rep to finally accept that we WERE NOT interested in attending the presentation. (I started off w/ a polite, ""no thanks, not interested""...and finally had to say a firm ""No"", and just walk away.)The hotel is in a great location---a block or two from Union Square, and close to a variety of bus/trolley routes, as well as BART. We bought a week long MUNI pass, ($45), good for cable car, bus and trolley. We did not use the Powell Street cable car, as the wait was always LONG.....but did take several rides on the California cable car, (never a wait/never crowded). We found several good pubs/cafes in the area. We did go to the rooftop lounge to relax & read the paper.....but mainly spent our days touring this beautiful city.

It was a careful selection and a hotel I was really looking forward to staying in. Check In was laboured due to being passed over to the concierge to introduce Wyndham properties which after a 10 hour trip was unneeded. No mention of the reason for our stay, let alone upgrades or gifts we had received in most other Cities. The room was nice, but nothing impressive and the pre visit photos had been carefully taken to suggest a bigger room than it was actually was, and clear to see why no pictures of the bathroom were posted. No enquires when we left as to our stay and only the concierge and bell boys wished us a safe trip.

693,"Our usual San Francisco hotel wasn't available for the dates we were there, but we found a great deal for the Donatello and decided to take the chance. I'm glad we did! First, a week before our stay, I received a phone call from a concierge asking if there we had any special requests. I said no, just a quiet room--the view wasn't important.Honestly, the hotel isn't much to look at from the outside; its a tall piece of 1960's concrete Brutalism dropped in the middle of historic Union Square buildings. But the interior is another story. The lobby is small but easy to navigate, and the front desk person had us checked in (early) within five minutes. They turned us over the concierge who gave us a rundown on current events and a discount book, plus a low-pressure pitch for ""Club Donatello"", which I gather is a reserved time-share type of arrangement on the hotel's top floor. When we told her we weren't interested she let it go.The room (a king) was large for San Francisco and the bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows (a big plus since we like reading in bed). There was a kitchenette area with a small refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, and its own sink, plus a full set of dinnerware, plates and bowls, plus dish washing liquid and a sponge. An alcove held a closet with bi-fold doors and a chest of drawers plus the luggage rack, so it was all out of the way. The long desk made a nice place to eat. There are power outlets and USB charging ports on all lamps and built into the desk.The bathroom, though small, was spotless (a big deal to me) and the shower was roomy with plenty of water pressure. The room was cleaned very efficiently early in the day, so after a long day of walking The City we came back to a freshly cleaned room.

Heaps of good restaurants and cafes, Walgreens for grocery and pharmacy goods, Starbucks and self serve or drop-off laundromats. The only negative was the anticipated time-share hard sell. Not only did they grab us during checkin to push the “free breakfast” and sales push, we were called twice on the first night by the concierge urging us to take them up on the offer. The second call was at 8:30pm - after we’d been asleep for over an hour due to our international flight.This practise needs to stop, as it just detracts from an otherwise perfect hotel experience.A note re the homeless situation in SF: this hotel was well situated with very few homeless people or panhandlers around.

716,"We have been here two times in about three years and both times we had very nice rooms and fine service. Except to the obligatory sales pitch from the time share salesperson, checking in would have been very quick. I realize that the salesperson has a sales quota, but applying pressure to attend an orientation is not the right thing to do when the travellers have spent much time to get to this destination and may be in need to get to their rooms. They will not take a ""not interested"" at this point and continue the pitch when they must realize that their target will probably be a no-show or turn down any offer made.The room was very clean and we liked the service bar that had a microwave oven and a full-sized coffee maker, seldom seen with single server machines used in so many hotels, and real plates and cutlery. There was also a small service sink that could be used in rinsing out dishes and for filling up the coffee maker. The bath room was very ample and there were plenty of towels. We were up around the sixth floor and it was very quiet considering the usual city noises.The car valet service worked like a charm and the parking rate was reasonable. One can find independent garages via internet parking service sites, but many of the ones close to the hotel were cheaper but did not have in-and-out privileges. The location is very good for downtown and it was close to the restaurants we had planned to visit and shopping was about two or three blocks away.We will return to this hotel, but would be a lot happier if I could somehow bypass that timeshare sales desk the next time back and give the hotel a higher rating.",16-Nov-18,"12    The Donatello

Our room on the 11th floor was clean spacious quiet and had everything we needed while 2 floors above was a comfortable rooftop lounge where you can take your own drinks or take advantage of the complementary tea coffee and hot chocolate on offer. There are also leisure facilities on this floor with a sauna spa and small gym.

The area around Union Square has plenty to offer and is a safe and pleasant environment, with most forms of transport close by. The hotel was very presentable, and everything functioned as it should. Our room on the 9th floor was very spacious and clean, looking out to the rear and hence largely unaffected by traffic noise. The staff were universally pleasant and helpful, and we appreciated being able to take advantage of the hospitality facilites on the 14th floor.That said, there were a couple of downsides: the sales pitch for the timeshare group (of which the hotel is part) was unwelcome on arrival, as our body clocks were at the middle of the night after our transatlantic flight. Also, the on-site restaurant was overly expensive for what was simply decent quality Italian food - maybe a reason why there is no menu in the room other than room service!",7-Oct-18,"12    The Donatello

The bathroom was a little small compared to the overall room size, but we were very comfortable and were happy to have the kitchenette with small fridge, microwave, sink, and countertop space with dishes and silverware. They also provided dish soap and sponge. We had a unique parking need because we were in a big SUV with a small luggage hitch attachment on the back. They had two oversized parking spaces right outside the front door for this situation and did not charge us anything additional (parking is $35/day, which is reasonable for San Francisco hotels). The front desk staff was very friendly, and the concierge gave us helpful information on the area and a city map. The best part: the lounge on the 15th floor! It had a small self-serve coffee/tea/water area, tables and chairs, a fireplace, and nice views of the city as well as doors to an outer patio area for some fresh air and closer look at the views.

The Hollywood Cafe across the street was yummy and is a better choice than the breakfast at the restaurant downstairs. The valet was $60/night but everywhere else was pretty pricy too. They have area near the lobby with games such as ping pong table and a few others games. A staff closed it up early at 8 pm indicating they have an event the next day but saw that it was actually 2 days later. The room was packed with guests playing the games and waiting to go see the fireworks on July 4th.

763,"My wife and I recently visited San Francisco and chose to stay at the Hyatt Centric Fisherman’s Wharf. First off, I would advise ignoring the counsel to avoid Fisherman’s Wharf. We found it to be convenient to everything we wanted to do and it (or the starting point for it) was all in easy walking distance. The FW area is about a 30 minute or so ride from SFO. There are several other property brands within a block or two including a Marriott, Sheraton and a Holiday Inn. From outside, the building is fairly unimpressive. Everything in the area appeared to be a bit dated but in the case of the HC, nicely maintained and mildly updated. We didn't have a car but I believe parking was $60 a night and there is a resort fee of $23.The lobby is a bit cramped primarily due to its long, narrow design. There is only one lobby-level elevator to the guestrooms which can get backed up but there are more available a level below. There is a large function room in the lower lobby that had ping pong and air hockey tables in it when we were there. There is a snack/convenience store that serves coffee next to the registration desk. There is also a very nice restaurant and bar onsite.We were greeted cheerfully by the front desk staff who very pleasantly and efficiently got us on our way to the room. My elite status with Hyatt was recognized and got us an upgrade to the Executive Suite and free breakfast. General décor was nice and as with the exterior and the lobby looked to be updated and well kept. The room was huge. There were separate living and bedroom areas and a large bathroom with a double vanity. The living room had a gigantic flat screen and a sectional sofa along with a bar housing the coffee service and a mini-fridge. There were plenty of outlets, updated connections to the TV and everything was in working order. The bedroom was nice with a (slightly obstructed) view of the bay bridge. It was large and had a large flat screen TV. The bed was comfortable except for the pillows (my only real complaint with Hyatt properties). Bathroom amenities were mid- to high end, the shower had been updated and there was good water pressure.There is no lounge at this property but we enjoyed the buffet breakfast every day. Wait staff were way pleasant accommodating a few special requests and taking extraordinarily good care of us.We enjoyed eating at Scoma’s, Ghirardelli Square is a short walk and the Big Bus Center is about 3 or 4 blocks away. They are right in the middle of it all.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here, will stay here again if we return and highly recommend it.",29-May-19,"13    Hyatt Centric Fisherman's Wharf San Francisco

Got a connecting room to a king room where grandparents stayed. Everyone had clean rooms. Great housekeeping. Free big bottle of water each day we stayed. Location excellent and close to the wharf. Would stay again.Downsides, I found room pricey. With exchange was basically $500/night. Maybe its the location, not sure but staying at the Wharf seemed to be the spot for everywhere we wanted to go or any tour we had to meet. Outdoor pool lovely but since it's so windy the closer you get to the water and the wind was quite cool, we really only took advantage of the hot tub which is a max of 6 people so my family filled it up! Our room had a very loud ""tinny"" sounding heating/cooling unit. I couldn't sleep with it going at night so I had to wear my earbuds and play white noise.Didn't use room service or anything. Had no issues, so cannot comment on service that way or response times.I would stay again as I did find it very clean, but again, very pricey!!

Bathroom of a good size though I still find Hyatt’s bathtub/shower curtain/shower combo very outdated.

Also the safe didn’t work but they sent a tech to replace the battery rather than give me another room. After the first night I wish I had pushed harder for a new room without having to incur a fee because I noticed the following: the bathroom door was sticky and unclean and the sheets on the bed had holes in them (see picture). The bottle of water isn’t complimentary (the note states there’s a $20 room fee that covers the water—- pricey bottle of water), however they didn’t bother to replenish it after they cleaned the room the following day.

792,"Reserved a room here for 2 nights based on reviews, location to our event, and photos from their website, which are misleading. The desk clerk was extremely welcoming and helpful to me and my daughter - we were on a road trip from Tennessee to Seattle and we stopped in SF for a friend's graduation. The hotel decor was worn, but charming. I enjoy staying in small boutique hotels and liked the idea of a nice bed and breakfast, especially after a road trip of staying in chain hotels along the highway. Our room was fine, seemed clean on first inspection. Again, a bit worn. It was very hot in the room, so I turned the thermostat to a cooler temp and even cracked the window. Decided to head to the lobby for the cookies and sherry that they offer in the late afternoon. That is when I saw the first mouse run across my path.So, yes, we are in a big city in a small hotel - this did not bum me out too much, actually. We named the mouse Annie - lol. Then I looked down to see a big fake fingernail on the floor at my feet. Ugh. Oh, and another mouse. Back to the room - it had an odor of dirty feet and the comforter seemed a bit suspect. I didn't want to use it, but had no choice when the sun went down and the room turned cold. Ok, turn the thermostat up, no problem. Nothing. No heat, no cool, nothing. Not sure if it even worked. A call to the front desk indicated that nothing could be done until morning. Just to be clear, at this point, I still wasn't completely turned off by the place. I decided to take a shower to warm up - that's when I saw the mold on the shower edges. Coming back into the room from the bathroom, I looked toward the bed and saw some gross smudges on the bed skirt - right where one would wipe one's hand as they were laying in bed. Still willing to give them a chance of redemption, I thought breakfast would be nice, just like their pictures on their website. I'm no snob and certainly appreciate the included breakfast at a Hampton Inn or similar place. I know what to expect there and am not disappointed. And I got the same thing but worse, literally the same flip flop Belgian waffle maker, the same kind of stale muffins, etc. at the Queen Anne,. Breakfast was better at the Hampton Inn that I had stayed at the night before in Bakersfield. I was done - bailed on this hotel and booked a room at the Omni - for practically the same price.

Staff were great and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is within 3-4 blocks walk of many fine restaurants. Can't wait for another excuse for a stay.",25-May-19,"14    Queen Anne Hotel

Bed impossible to sleep in, very hard, with questionable throw pillows and bedspread. Furniture worn and tatty; didn't want to trust my clothes to the dresser drawers. It was chilly but I looked in vain for a thermostat to turn up the heat - there was none. On the way to the airport, stopped in for the complimentary breakfast and left almost immediately.

802,"This is the second time I have stayed at the Queen Anne, both times for the same reason: a training conference held at the Holiday Inn on Van Ness Avenue, six fairly short blocks from this hostelry. I consider this a great secret for other conference-goers in the neighborhood, as the Queen Anne charges almost exactly half the rate at the larger hotel. Did I miss any amenities? Absolutely not. My room was on the top (fourth) floor and may have originally been used by an employee, as my ceiling had a sharp slope that probably allowed for a dormer window I couldn't see. The bed was comfortable and the well appointed bathroom roomy, with a shower that was easy to operate and provided full coverage. In addition, I was offered a full breakfast buffet--and I do mean full! Fruits, juices, cereals, hard-boiled eggs, breakfast meats, an array of breads and quite possibly more things I don't recall, were displayed attractively. I had fun creating my own light waffle in a rotating pan, and it was delicious. We guests ate in a dining room that seemed, by virtue of how it is arranged, to encourage friendly exchanges and mutual offers of help and information. During my first stay, the hotel was undergoing the final stages of refurbishment. It is now completely decorated, and charming. The employees were, without fail, friendly and helpful. During both my visits, I was allowed to leave my car in the hotel lot at no extra charge during the second day of the conference. This is no small gift in San Francisco where street parking is practically non-existent and garage parking, if spaces are available, is very expensive. A final note: I didn't give five stars because that might lead folks to expect a very polished, perhaps elegant place to stay. This is more like a charming inn or B&B.",16-Feb-19,"14    Queen Anne Hotel

805,"Upon arrival Queen Anne still had extensive Christmas decorations everywhere that suited the Victorian style. Everything looked magical.Our room 415 on the 4th floor complete with peacock wallpaper was fine. We were going out the first evening, so we needed to iron clothes. The iron didn't work, neither did the night lamp. The iron was quickly exchanged, the night lamp was never exchanged. We were spending 6 days in SF at the Queen Anne. Breakfast the first morning was a disappointment. In the reception it's called an ""exclusive continental breakfast"". Check out the posted pictures. The boiled eggs were green inside. Nothing home-cooked, but cheap muesli, pastries, etc. No yogurt or healthy items. Bananas got more and more rotten along the way. We ended up having breakfast other places even though breakfast was included.We asked the concierge for assistance booking a table for 5 for our last evening. She didn't get through on the phone 5 days before we wanted the reservation and never followed up. We ended up walking to Octavia 1 block away and made the reservation ourselves. One of the last evenings while sitting in the impressive living room by the fireplace, at least one mouse turned up and ran around the room. This was addressed to the receptionist, who jotted down my name. The next morning I also mentioned it, where the receptionists reaction was ""this is a first time "". This attitude combined with lack of cleanliness (staircase wasn't vacuumed during our 6 days stay even though I addressed it after 3 days) was the last drop. Therefore the rating 2.

The rooms bedspreads and curtains need replaced. My impression is the owners have made a cheap attempt to decorate, the framed paintings and pictures are very cheap replicas. Attention to detail is so important, especially if you want return guest. The breakfast while a nice offer , leaves so much to be desired we chose to eat elsewhere, even the coffee was not good. While looking forward to our overnight, I certainly would not recommend the Hotel to friends or family, and I do not think we will return, I wish I could say I would.

815,"Booked this hotel by reviews and was disappointed. This was not my first stay in SF but it was my first stay in the neighborhood. The good: beautiful lobby, safe neighborhood, decent breakfast (included), free cookies and sherry every afternoon if you're in the hotel mid-afternoon, one room has a fireplace. The bad: 1. One of the two rooms was tiny (smallest room according to the floor plan) but that didn't bother us so much. 2. The carpet in one of the rooms smelled bad (think old carpet smell in your grandma's house) - so bad that we had to leave the door open during the day. When we forgot to leave the door open one day, we came back to an awful smell again. 3. The windows was those old kind of windows without any noise insulation at all - such that at night a car driving by woke us up. Unexpected for a hotel in San Francisco in 2018. 4. Heat made a horrible sound - it almost kept us at night. 5. Our door did not close naturally, we had to actively pull it open every time we left the room. Again, this is a $200/night hotel in 2018. 6. Wifi did not work in our bed. Our room wifi only extended to the hallway and in the bathroom. 7. They charge $30 a night for parking, but neglect to tell you that there is free street parking at night time in this neighborhood. 8. Not the hotel's fault, but the neighborhood this is located in (Japantown) basically only has Asian food places and is mostly residential - not many bars/restaurants/cafes located within 10-15 min walk. We liked the quiet atmosphere but this is something to know.

They remembered our names and helped with other details of our stay. The hotel is full of antiques and it is like stepping into a different era. We had a spacious room and when it got warm, they delivered a fan that did the job. They offer a glass of sherry and cookies in the living room (parlor) in the evening and continental breakfast in the morning. The hotel says it is a ""bed and breakfast hotel"" and that's exactly the feel. You can sit by a fire in a beautiful setting.

834,"We visited San Francisco to see La Traviata at the opera, and came across this hotel somewhat accidentally. We were looking for a high quality hotel under $300. We ended up loving this hotel (and the staff). This hotel is like a time capsule from 1890. The first floor public rooms are filled with comfortable antiques that seem in almost new condition. The first floor has a large number of comfortable places to sit and read (including by the fire). Our room was on the 3rd floor. There's a modern elevator, but at least once you have to take the stairs to get the full 1890 effect! Our room faced Sutter street, and we didn't encounter any street noise (and I'm a fairly light sleeper). The breakfast room is large, and also appears from 1890. There were cereals, hard boiled eggs, sausage, waffles, muffins, and a number of other items. The one thing I thought would be a negative (being about 15 blocks from Union Square) turned out to be a positive- no crowds and VERY easy to get an Uber or Lyft. I never had to wait more than 3 minutes. At Union Square, you're competing with dozens of others, and how does your driver find you? We liked this hotel so much, we're going back in December.",5-Oct-17,"14    Queen Anne Hotel

835,Stayed here for four nights and loved my stay at the hotel. We had the superior twin room which had 2 big very comfy double beds. The room had a lovely view from the bay window and was lightly decorated. Staff are friendly and extermelly friendly. Sherry and cookies from 4pm is a nice touch its lovely to relax after a day of sight seeing in the parlour.

Proximity to Filmore and Geary streets is two blocks walking. The parlor is a lovely wide expanse of antique furniture, cozy fire places and quiet nooks.

837,"My wife found this place after seeing the apt which I rented through bnb website. let's move on quickly - that was nasty. this hotel felt historic from the moment you walked in the door. sure enough you start to notice the chandeliers, the antique furniture, the pictures, the wallpaper, etc that this place has an incredible story to tell. Asking the concierge, he explained that yes, the building is from the late 1800's. let that sink in for a minute. Now imagine the walls, the furniture pieces, the hand rails to the stairs, the wallpaper, carpets and everything else that is this Queen Anne Hotel. It turns out, that the Hotel as it is today is actually only half of what it once was. The famous fire of 1906, which was destroyed or consumed 80% of the city. Breakfast made you feel like you were Royalty. All the squeaky floors as you walked and the elevator....had the same bench from what I assume was the person who ran the elevator for their guest 100 years ago? It was mentioned later about the supposed ghost that still roams? We felt nothing. no presence of any ghost.",14-Sep-17,"14    Queen Anne Hotel

The hotel was quaint, and the breakfast could have been a little more varied. Our stay was pleasant enough, and the decor quaint, although the room was a bit smelly, but maybe this was the effect of Mary Lake? Parking was provided in one of the adjoining side streets and this was a plus.

I really like this area as it is close to the tenderloin and union square. The hotel was very comfortable and clean. Staff were friendly.

We had an 11th floor room with good views over Grace Cathedral and distant views of both the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. Location was very peaceful at weekend and nice to walk down to both Fisherman's Wharf and the Embarcadero (you will need to take a cable car/taxi/Uber back due to being on top of a very steep hill)The club lounge is a little strange as it is in the middle of the small bar/restaurant on the ground floor. The area is well policed albeit we had some interlopers enjoying the evening snacks one night. There are very few ""comfy"" chairs - most are stools/high tables, but the décor is classy and service attentive during the evening. Complimentary cocktail food was high quality and the open bar had a small selection of beers, wines and spirits available 5-7pm (it would have been nice to have more soft drinks such as cranberry or tomato juice). Breakfast was a little more chaotic with club guests mixed with the main breakfast service in the small restaurant. Once you were identified as club you were pretty much left on your own after the first coffee was poured. We found Orange Juice at the waiters stations and the buffet had a reasonable choice of breakfast items and was available until 11am if you wanted a lie-in. Fresh fruit (including home made smoothies), cookies, hot and cold beverages were available all day.We really enjoyed this piece of San Francisco history.

873,"I remember back when I was in my early 20's visiting San Francisco, I had walked by the Mark Hopkins Hotel and had my picture taken in front of the doors. I remember thinking at the time that I doubt I would ever be able to afford to stay at such a hotel.Well, little faith I had at that time, for this past week my wife and I stayed here for 5 nights. Loved our stay.I would have to say, the service here was exceptional...whether it was the welcome you receive when checking in, or the doorman grabbing the door for you. Our room was always spotless and made up everyday. Loved the location at the top of the hill...kind of centrally located for our needs. The room had all the amenities we needed and the internet was fast and reliable. Tried breakfast and the bar downstairs...excellent. Unfortunately we never made it to the Top of the Mark...next time.The only negative I can offer is the bed...not as comfortable as I would have hoped.

The hotel is in a very pretty neighbourhood and many attractions are easily walkable (Fisherman's Wharf and Alcatraz' departure pier). We were also amazed by the architecture of the hotel itself and the decoration of the bedroom and lobby.We both were very happy with our stay, and would immediately recommend this hotel.

891,"The Intercontinental Mark Hopkins SF is a gorgeous hotel—but exteriorly only. After walking in, there are only 5 registers to check you in and 3 very small elevators to take you up. Each elevator can only hold about 6-7 people (less with luggage) and they run exceptionally slow. During evening hours, one is designated to Top of the Mark and you’re down to 2 elevators. When asked to take the stairs, we were told they don’t go to the 5th floor (that was a lie). Bottom line for the elevators, be expected to wait 5-10 minutes to ride on one. Onto the rooms...While I understand this is a historic icon, the decor is very dated and run down. The bathroom is incredibly small and narrow. There are no outlets by the night stands and only one near the desk. Overall, this hotel needs some renovations to accommodate the influx of customers. It definitely doesn’t hold up to the standard 4 star hotel. The only saving factor for this hotel is the name and location, otherwise it’s very disappointing.",4-Jan-19,"15    InterContinental Mark Hopkins San Francisco

892,The Mark Hopkins is a San Francisco classic. As such there are some minor inconveniences that come with age. One such inconvenience is the elevator service. The three elevators are small and two service the busy Top of the Mark. During prime times be prepared to wait a long time for an elevator. I recommend the 15th floor for the best elevator service. The middle level floors are difficult for down elevator service. Otherwise the hotel is excellent in all ways. The staff is friendly and efficient. The rooms are clean and spacious. The location at the top of Nob Hill is nice but may be difficult for some to navigate. In summary the Mark Hopkins is an experience to try at least once.

893,"I stay here a couple of times a year when in San Francisco for events or visiting family and not wanting to drive the hour and a half home, or just to have fun in the City.This most recent visit Thanksgiving weekend was my best because of an upgrade to a suite with an atrium and private terrace. In the past I have upgraded myself (paid) for a room with a large outdoor terrace but it did not have an atrium. I think here is only one room in the hotel with the atrium and terrace.Because this was an upgrade (not paid for) I did not have access to the InterContinental Suite like I have had in the past when staying in a suite here, and that was fine because I have never found the Club InterContinental here to be very exciting. (Although on one stay the Club on the second floor was closed for some reason and they instead were using a hospitality suite on an upper floor - the Mark Hopkins Suite, I believe - and it was much better than the regular Club.)What's not to like about a private atrium and terrace with views of the Golden Gate Bridge all the way to the Bay Bridge? The large bathroom also had a big whirlpool tub which I enjoyed very much. And I love the REAL plants in the suites and rooms at the Mark Hopkins.Because of the wonderful suite I had most meals in and as always, the room service is excellent here. And one evening I got to speak with the room service order-taking person Carolyn who remembered me from past visits. I do feel like family at this property.The only bummer on my stay was a rather tactless bartender at the Top of the Mark one evening.My cousin joined me for the holiday Sunday brunch at the Top of the Mark and while very pricy, the food is very good and you cannot beat the view.Thank you Mark Hopkins for the wonderful upgrade and I very much look forward to my next visit.",18-Dec-18,"15    InterContinental Mark Hopkins San Francisco

There were so many things that tarnished our stay. The overall property is tired. The furniture in our room was chipped and scratched, there were not enough outlets or mirrors. The beds are very small as well. The hallway was cluttered with dishes and trays outside of doors and it looked like the hallway carpets hadn’t been vacuumed in a very long time.The elevators are very slow and we took to walking the stairs to the 12th floor. Many people are coming to The Top of the Mark , but they really should have a separate elevator for them. We went up to enjoy a cocktail at The Top of the Mark, wish I could say we did. We waited to get in...no problem, but the waiting area is so small. People were jammed in elbow to elbow. When we were finally seated, we waited 45 minutes and never even got a glass of water, which we asked for twice, We realize a wait is inevitable, but 45 minutes for water is not okay. We ended up leaving because there was no point in waiting any longer. We let the hostess know why we were leaving and went elsewhere. We also let them know at checkout about the experience. We’ve been on many girls’ trips and don’t expect perfection. We do expect good customer service from a highly touted hotel.

The windows open bringing in lots of fresh air, yet the rooms are quiet and comfortable. The service at the hotel was fantastic. We only experienced the breakfast buffet which was excellent. They offer Asian styled breakfast, Italian style breakfast, and the normal American favorites. The service in the dining room was super friendly and warm. We were there during the Christmas season and there were choirs in the lobby and Santa was also there visiting with children in front of an enormous Christmas Tree. A very, very festive holiday spot.

916,Hotel Zoe is pretty much what you might expect from a city centre hotel It was well furnished with a nice large lobby offering water all day and coffee in the morning.The staff were generally very helpful and any requests were dealt with promptly. The reception did get overwhelmed quite often. I felt the concierge wasn’t particularly keen to find out what we wanted but more to offer things that they get a commission on. However she was helpful with general information.There was a small bar and the drinks were quite expensive but nothing out of the ordinary for San Francisco. The room was smallish but well catered and serviced every day.The outside area off the lobby was pleasant and also the fire in the main area - we warmed ourselves at it a few times after coming in from a foggy walk along Fisherman's Wharf.The location was excellent - two minutes from Fisherman’s Wharf and near the trolley bus to Union Square. We thought the Italian restaurant attached was quite ordinary foodwise and the dinner menu expensive- dinner seemed to offer less choices that lunch leaving on the more expensive options for evening dining. Staff were lovely though.They pulled the stops out getting an taxi for the airport when our SuperShuttle let us down badly - being able to summon a taxi immediately. Many thanks!There were bike and scooters to use which was a nice touch even though we didn't use them.,2-Jul-19,"16    Hotel Zoe Fisherman's Wharf

The concierge is very helpful and the rooms are ok. Front desk staff were very hard nosed and made absolutely no allowances for the fact that we were staying six nights, which I think is poor on their part. Every request was batted straight back from a later checkout to a quiet room. I paid up front in April and was then emailed with a special offer by the hotel of $20 a night spend in Pescatore. All I got was one $20 spend which in the small print said it was only valid for lunch and dinner-not breakfast. This is penny pinching your guests and not good customer service.

I think being a boutique hotel doesn't mean you don't train your staff. I was traveling with my wife and 1 year old kid, and was staying for 3 nights. This hotel is not a kid friendly place; we were given room on 1st floor where there are about 8-10 flight of stairs from the lobby. I requested if they can allocate a room that has elevator access such as a 2nd floor, and the message I got was this was the last room and we are fully booked. There isn't a ramp where you can take your stroller; we have to literally lift the stroller when our kid was sleeping up and down the stairs!!! They couldn't provide with very basic things that every other hotel in San Francisco provide, such as - Microwave/Kettle to heat milk, and Baby Cot. For the price we were paying, we could've as well gotten at the bigs ones such as Hyatt or Marriott as their staff will be properly trained and are kid friendly. The cleanliness of the room was subpar; we noticed hair on the bed upon checkin and when complained, was moved around to a different room on the same floor.

953,Moment we checked in we felt like the hotel had their hands in our pockets.Cost for parking at the hotel is 70$ + taxes for a large SUV.We found secure 24 hours parking above SAFEWAY supermarket right next to a busy 24hrs Gym on the 2nd floor on Mason street at the crossing of North Point Road. This was at 36$ flat for 24 hours and could be accessed any time. We even left our bags in the car overnight to make early start to the airport next morning.We requested a room with a bit of a street view but was told by the receptionist that ALL rooms were only courtyard views. Later when we walked out and noticed a large no. of street view rooms.Don't expect complementary tea/coffee in the room. On request it will come at a cost of 29$ per day as GUEST AMENITIES FEE which was never mentioned to us when we requested for one.When we arrived in our room my daughter mentioned the toilet was as big as an Aircraft toilet & in reality it was only slightly bigger.Housekeeping require you to be out of your room by about 11 am or else they put notes under your door saying the room will not be cleaned that day.Better be very sure about your Check In & Check Out dates as they DO NOT refund any money if you make changes to your bookings under any circumstances.,9-Jun-19,"16    Hotel Zoe Fisherman's Wharf

954,"Stayed at this hotel for the 2nd time in one year. Got to stay in the upgraded room which is pretty neat except for the noise. The loud sounds of the elevator are so disturbing through the night that their fancy sound conditioner failed to beat! However we left very disappointed because my 2.5 year olds’ stuffed animal got lost from our room. We probably left it in our bed and during cleaning it may have been taken away accidentally by the cleaning staff. It could’ve been something more valuable and it just goes to show how careless their cleaning staff is. I tried reaching out to the front desk, lost and found and then also the manager about it but they couldn’t do anything. The issue was reported within an hour and still they couldn’t do anything about it. Hard to believe they couldn’t track their laundry and don’t know where it went. We left very disappointed because our 2.5 year old has no way to understand what happened to his baby shark and is pretty sad. I hope they are able to still find it and ship it to us as they promised and also are very very careful in the future when making the beds and cleaning the rooms to not be wrapping up people’s precious things in.",12-Jul-19,"17    San Francisco Marriott Marquis

955,"My sister works for Marriot so I get the explorer rate which is awesome. I booked two rooms thinking that I could use the assuming I could use the rate for both. I had no idea I could not . My sister never told me and I’ve used my rate just on one room many times. So when I arrived to check in the woman at the check in counter told me the rate cannot be applied for a second room . Not knowing this I told her , “ I had know idea about that rule. Honestly I was not informed and definitely don’t want to get my sister in trouble “. She explained she is going to have to charge me for a cancellation fee. I told her it was an honest mistake could you please let me slide on the fee or could you call the manager? So she called the manager, And explained that I had the explore rate and I booked two rooms do we charge a cancellation fee? I am in a Repton said you didn’t tell her I made an honest mistake and I didn’t know that! She whispered in the phone he says he didn’t know that. Long story short I talk to them manager face to face she wasn’t budging to charge me the whole I’ve been out of the room as cancellation fee didn’t want to hear my story followed me around the lobby as I went to the bellhop I was so mad I’m in barest for Marriott as I know they’re not like this I will never stay at that place ever again. I will tell all my clients not to stay there. The whole point being she didn’t have the time or day to listen to my explanation I screwed up I’ll be accountable.

960,This is hotel is very conveniently located for people who are at SFO for business to be conducted downtown. I stayed here to attend a conference at Moscone Center and it was just walking distance from the hotel. It wouldn't be wrong to describe that the hotel is located centrally being just walking distance from Union Square and other landmark places.Its a very busy hotel and yet the front office is smooth and prompt in its service. I got to stay at the 19th floor at one of the newly remodelled rooms - as the reception executive described- and i found the room spacious and accommodative. The window overlooked the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) and St Patrick Catholic church. The room came equipped with a wifi Tablet providing info about the city and the hotel. Many services of the room could be time managed with this tab - which is a good feature. The room had utilities like iron/ironing table and an electric kettle. The breakfast at the hotel was very substandard but I truly believe that it was so because the rooms were bought as a block deal by the conference managers who decided on a low cost menu to boost their own margins. The hotel shouldn't have agreed for such a third class breakfast plummeting their own standards. That's the only bleak spot on their repertoire during my stay.,28-Jun-19,"17    San Francisco Marriott Marquis

The newly renovated hotel included the following deficits: inexplicable flashing light on the phone, lamp by the bed did not provide enough light to read a picture book, no adjustable desk chair, only one chair in the suite (bedroom and sitting room), no luggage rack (actually nowhere to set luggage except the floor or in the sitting room), the sofa was no more comfortable than sitting on a park bench, and no room service. The biggest problem is that the shower stall had absolutely nothing to hold onto - someone is going to fall and the hotel will be vulnerable. Again, staff were super responsive but they can't change the furniture or redesign the shower! And this was not a cheap stay.

974,"I stayed at the Marriott Marquis for 4 nights in June, while attending a conference. Everyone from the front desk staff, the housekeeping staff and restaurant personnel were so friendly and helpful. The newer room was beautiful, with an incredibly comfortable bed and pillows and a fabulous bathroom with walk-in shower. Around the hotel are a variety of restaurants, and the sights of San Francisco are a short cab ride away (Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39, Chinatown, Presidio, Golden Gate bridge, etc.).One thing to consider, however, is this hotel and this city is EXPENSIVE. It's also difficult to see so many homeless people passed out on the street, outside of restaurants and in the parks. Lastly, regarding the conference: the space itself was fine (but in the basement, like many other hotels so no natural light) but the food that was served each day was HORRIBLE. Some of the worst conference food I have ever had. The first two days we were served the same dry kale salad (just dressed a bit differently each day), the same tasteless dry chicken breast (just prepared differently each day), with no option for something else to drink but water or coffee/hot tea with dessert. The continental breakfast was also EXACTLY the same each morning, except one day they didn't offer the boiled eggs that were served the other days. ",14-Jun-19,"17    San Francisco Marriott Marquis

We got a room on the 9th floor - no view of the city - but we were fine with that. The windows were big enough to let lots of natural light in when we needed it and we didn't hear any street noise. The floor itself was super quiet and we heard nothing from other guests. The hotel was busy but big enough that it doesn't feel crowded. Check-in was a breeze. Staff is exceptional. We opted not to rent a car, using public transportation and rideshares and it was perfectly fine since the hotel is within walking distance of many places we wanted to visit or as a starting point for the tours we did. The option to rent a car was provided by a Hertz in the hotel. We also were able to book a tour to Muir Woods through the hotel and were picked up in front the hotel. All very convenient.

1002,"This Marriott is well-located for conventions and has loads of amenities---which is why I returned in April for my third stay. However, a recent change to the rewards program now denies access to the Clum M lounge to Gold members (it is for Platinum only). The benefit and value of this for breakfast, and an occasional snack previously made the premium price of this hotel worth it. I was disappointed to be denied access to the Club M, and even asked a manager for an exception. I was told it was too busy that week, yet in passing by I often saw lots of empty tables. Now it seems that the only benefits that saves any money that is available to members below Platinum level is free internet, which any level member gets. I loved my corner room with a view, but will have to evaluate my total budget for my next trip. Colleagues stayed at AirBNBs and a diff hotel nearby, and saved considerable money.

The second morning we decided to have breakfast at the hotel. There was a basket with about 8 croissants and we (family of 3) ate two croissants each. The girl from reception had the cheek to tell my wife that we ate all croissants and they were for the whole hotel. Unbelievable. We have paid $540 for two nights in lousy room in great need of updating only to be told we had too many croissants. Unprofessional and incompetent is an understatement.

1020,"The Grove Inn occupies a lovely Italianate-Victorian style building with plenty of curb appeal, its crisply clean exterior decorated with charming historic accents. Situated in a low-key, peaceful neighborhood, it is within easy walking distance of Alamo Square Park, the Painted Ladies, Golden Gate Park, Haight-Ashbury, Japantown, and many other attractions. Nearby you’ll find grocery stores, bars, and restaurants, including a good seafood place right across the street. It has ready access to public transportation, or, of course, Uber. We arrived in the afternoon and were smoothly checked-in by Mark, the warm and friendly manager. The stairs were somewhat daunting, but we knew this place had stairs before booking. Immaculate and comfortable, the room had two big windows providing pleasing daylight, a desk (the television was on it), two nightstands, and an excellent bed. We stayed in a corner room overlooking a side street. Yes, there was traffic and trolley noise, but it didn’t bother us. The sink is in the sleeping area, not the bathroom. This also didn’t bother us. For one night, or even two, this place was perfect for us. The rate we paid was more than a bargain, and you’d be hard-pressed to find better value in the immediate vicinity. The breakfast was a simple, mostly “dry” self-serve buffet, which was fine.But, if you’re like me, the little things that you can overlook for one night grow into annoyances the longer you stay. We stayed three nights, and several things wore on me. There is no thermostat in the room, and no way to control the temperature other than asking someone at reception, which is not helpful late at night. The oddly configured bathroom has no towel rack immediately accessible from the shower. The shower stall was too small (I’m 5’ 5” and 130 pounds), and the shower curtain plastered itself to me each time I stepped too close to it to avoid the suddenly changing temperature from the touchy shower control - yuck. The room has no clock, no fridge, and no microwave. The hotel has a shared fridge guests can use downstairs in the breakfast area, which is locked at night. We knew about the fridge when we booked, but we did end up missing having one in the room. The customer service changed somewhat on the weekend, when two different young women replaced Mark, and neither was overly friendly.A note to first-time San Francisco visitors (we have family here): I described the neighborhood as peaceful, but you should be careful to maintain situational awareness at all times when you are out walking, especially around the parks, and particularly at night. A little caution will help you enjoy a safe, problem-free visit.Overall, the Grove Inn is a clean, pretty, professionally run and comfortable establishment in a perfect location, providing great value and a reliable home base for your San Francisco stay.",18-Jan-18,"18    The Grove Inn

The room was comfortable - the very high ceilings give it a spacious feel that is rare in an urban hotel, even in a bed and breakfast. The TV was mounted very high into a corner, but I didn't mind too much. The tall ceiling made the shower stall and bathroom feel especially large which was really nice, along with the option to use the handheld showerhead or the fixed showerhead.

I lived in the city for a long time and hence didn't know too much about the hotel situation here, but in our search for lodging for a weekend trip, we found the city to be very expensive! The Grove Inn, however, had a great price (best price I found, incidentally was booking directly with them) and good reviews. So I was a little worried before arriving, but as it turns out, I shouldn't have been.It's somewhere between a traditional B&B and a hotel. It honestly felt a bit like we had an apartment and were living in SF instead of just vacationing for the weekend. Something about the facade of the building, and the fact that it's on a very residential street.Our room was small, but nice and clean. Staff is very friendly. Some reviews mentioned having trouble with the lobby door, so we were a bit worried about that. But this must have been an old issue. It's now a key fob system and it gave us absolutely no trouble.There was one hiccup with breakfast, but the staff proactively made it right without us having to say anything, so they honestly scored points with this.This will be my go to SF hotel from now on.",25-Sep-17,"18    The Grove Inn

Location is quite central that it is about $10 Uber ride to most places in the city. One girl at the front desk was not very friendly, but the other was really nice. Most people follow the rules, so it was fine. A lot of good coffee shops within walking distance. The problem is the bathroom. I understand San Francisco is not a cheap place to stay, but I would expect my room to come with a more proper bathroom. I booked a ""Deluxe Queen with Bay Window"". It is supposed to be the second most expensive room on the estate (the most expensive is the suite). When I opened the door of the bathroom, I was surprised. It is dated and only got a tiny shower. The sink is outside of the bathroom near the entrance of the room. The slide door does not lock properly because the property is older so the door was slightly out of alignment. Lucky that I was staying with my husband so we could still sort it out. Toilet button is broke although it still flashes properly. The toilet seat rocks it bit too (I am only 110lbs). Grouting in the shower is moldy and I found 2 hair inside of it too. I remembered the bathroom on the website was much nicer and I found they put ""your booked room may differ slightly from rooms displayed in photos"". Great, but I would not say that is ""slightly"".

1030,"We stayed five nights at The Grove Inn and highly recommend this B&B. It's well located in a residential neighborhood, with good access to public transportation and within easy reach to several of San Francisco's attractions. There's also several bars and restaurants a short walk from the Inn. Our bedroom was clean, well kept, with a cosy decoration - following the victorian style of the house - and had a very good bed. Breakfast was also good, with a nice variety of fresh breads and pastries (for instance, the best blueberry muffins I had in the USA). Just be aware of the check-in hours, as they only allow for check-inn until 11:00 PM (we barely made it on arrival, as our flight to SFO was delayed).",18-Feb-17,"18    The Grove Inn

1040,"We began our search for interesting accommodation about 2 months ago and noted that the The Grove Inn was already starting to fill. After comparing options with hotels ($$$$), Air B&B (little selection) and other Inns/B&Bs (smaller with limited availability), we found ourselves returning online to look again at this location. We took the plunge, booked two rooms and have just finished seven nights there. We are glad we did.The Grove Inn is located just one block away from the Painted Ladies, which you, after walking around the neighbourhood, will realize are just another bunch of attractive Victorian homes. The Inn itself is a moderately well-appointed establishment that has a history of accommodating people back to the mid-1800s. There are about a dozen rooms in various configurations and our two rooms were the Queen with bay window and the deluxe double room. The room is well-sized, but not huge. Bedding is crisp and white and beds are moderately firm with a pillow top. The only discussion point might be the compact bathroom, but the shower pressure is good and the toilets flush quietly. Unlike many other B&Bs there is no common area with comfy sofas, but face it: one is not in San Francisco to hang about the hotel. There is no onsite parking, but other reviewers have suggested options nearby.The inn staff members are attentive and helpful and work from the office for about 12 hours per day, locking up at night. Late night arrivals can be accommodated, though, because the staff can buzz you in remotely and you will find your keys in an envelope just inside the front door. Breakfast is continental, with a couple of cereals, fresh fruit, boiled eggs, OJ, and some excellent baked goods from The Mill bakery on nearby Divisadero street. If you have to check out early to catch a flight, the staff will leave a tray of food in your room the night before. Finally, several great dinner options exist within walking distance (about 4 blocks away) in Hayes Valley and there are a couple more good eating establishments on Divisadero. In short, the Grove Inn is a really great place to stay if you are not wedded to the idea of being in a big hotel downtown.",19-Nov-16,"18    The Grove Inn

1045,"This is a very sweet, but still clean and modern inn. There is a continental breakfast that is more European than American, reminds me of a lot of breakfasts I had in hostels and hotels in Europe. The breakfast isn't super impressive, but will be enough to fill you up for a day of sight seeing. When we arrived, someone showed us our room but mentioned that there was a suite available if we would rather have that. We were traveling with an infant, so we were thrilled to have the suite with an extra room so that we could still have a light/the tv on after the baby went to sleep. The only negative was that the inn did not have any cribs, which was somewhat surprising. However, luckily I had called ahead to ask about the crib so we were prepared, and rented a pack-n-play from a baby rental service. But that is the only negative I would say about the inn, so if you don't need a crib, then I would highly recommend. I loved the area it was in, and actually booked the inn after asking a friend who recently lived in San Francisco where to stay. This was not a touristy area at all, but felt more like when you stay in an air bnb and are really in a neighborhood where locals hang out and live. Painted ladies is around the corner, Patricia's green area is nearby and has a beer garden and other great bars and shops, the Inn is on the corner of Fillmore street and if you go a bit north on that there is a great shopping and dining.",24-Oct-16,"18    The Grove Inn

Extras included a nice breakfast, and coffee maker in the room, coffee all day, fruit and internet. The rooms are small and crowded, a sink was in the room, the bathroom was minuscule, and there is a steep Victorian staircase up to the room.

It’s within walking distance to most big theatres like the Golden Gate and the Curran, plus it’s next to many terrific restaurants like Roxanne’s Café, Maru Sushi, and next door to the landmark Sears Fine Food.The Chancellor’s lobby is warm and inviting like a little jewel box. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. We did offsite parking one block away for just $20, the cheapest rate you’ll find in SF! Our room, 1402, was clean, fresh and very stylish. The bed was extremely comfortable and the linens were top-quality. The towels were plush and the soap/shampoo were high quality. The hotel doesn’t pretend to be something it’s not (like a boring cookie-cutter chain) but rather it celebrates being an old-school, elegant SF property. Just two cons: there isn’t any air-conditioning, which didn’t pose a problem in March, but may be an issue in August or September. However, there is a modern, well-run ceiling fan, an extra fan in the closet, and widows that open all the way. The second con: no coffee in the rooms. To their credit, I was fully aware of both cons before I booked the hotel. We didn’t eat their offered breakfast ($18), but went next door to Sears Fine Food (we’d been wanting to try it). Otherwise we would have tried it. The variety looked delicious. The value for your money was well worth it. Yes, it was March (likely a shoulder month) but at $159 plus taxes it couldn’t be beat.

1108,"I recently stayed at this hotel with my husband while we were in town for a conference. It was more affordable than the conference hotel and conveniently located in Union Square - a vibrant, walkable area with plenty of restaurants, entertainment and large retail stores. It's a quaint hotel, but we enjoyed the complimentary coffee and free cookies in the lobby! We didn't have much of a view; our room was facing a couple of buildings. However, it was not something that was super important to us on this particular occasion.There are a few things in this hotel that we did not take advantage of because we were on the go, such as the buffet breakfast for $18 a person and the bar (they had a 2 for 1 drink special). However, we appreciated at least having those options available to us! My only complaint about the hotel is that once daily, someone from the staff knocked on our door at a random time - once about a radiator out in the hallway (that was not ours), once about replacing a shower curtain (which we did not request), and once about something that we didn't bother to find out about because we did not want to be disturbed and therefore didn't answer the door. There was no 'Do Not Disturb' sign to put on the door and I'm sure the hotel staff were well meaning, but during the few moments of downtime that we had in the room outside of sleeping at night, it would have been nice to not have anyone knocking for random things.Overall, this is a nice hotel that provides many amenities and is in a great location. My only recommendation is to have 'Do Not Disturb' signs for all of the rooms. It's possible that the one for our room was simply missing, but I'm noting this anyway - just in case!",26-Jan-19,"19    Chancellor Hotel on Union Square

1120,"We stayed here for 3 nights whilst visiting San Fransisco from the UK. As we spent most of the day out-and-about we only really used the room to sleep. On checking in the receptionist was rather abrupt and we were given a room upstairs which was very musty and had mould on the walls. We requested to move rooms, and were given a room on the ground floor. This room still smelt but there were no obvious signs of mould. The rooms were fairly comfortable, but they were not as clean/ modern as they look on the photos. The walls and ceilings are very thin, so we were woken very early each morning when the room above us woke up. We had a car with us, and the free hotel parking was very useful. We were lucky to always manage to have a space during our stay (there are not enough spaces for all rooms).The location was fine, and we could get everywhere we wanted to via bus/ taxi, and there were a few nice restaurants within walking distance. If we returned we would probably not stay in this location, nor this hotel.",4-May-19,"20    Seaside Inn

1121,"I travelled with friends from the UK and stayed for a week. The gentleman at reception was polite and helpful which we needed after a long flight. The room, bathroom and linen was clean and the beds very comfortable. Luckily we were on the ground floor as there is no lift so bear this in mind if travelling with a lot of luggage! The room could do with a bit of a facelift in terms of the carpet and paint however it was comfortable. The continental style breakfast was a nice touch and enough to get us started for the day. Very good daily housekeeping. The Inn is in an excellent location. The Bay Area/Gharardelli square is about a 20 minute walk and Fisherman’s Wharf another 10 minutes. There are excellent views on the way if you walk over the park area opposite Safeway. The Hop On bus goes from just up the road (5 minute walk) and is easily accessible for the trolley buses and cable cars. There is an excellent Safeway supermarket about 10 minute walk away and there are a couple of convenience stores around the corner. The main downside for us was that there is no safety deposit box in the room so we had to carry our cash and passports everywhere. We were offered the choice to leave these at reception but would have preferred a safe in the room. It did not have the luxuries of some hotels but if you are looking for a place to lay your head after a busy day it is a clean and comfortable choice in a safe and easily accessible location.",3-May-19,"20    Seaside Inn

I can’t see what that has to do with a hotelier!

1124,"Good location on Lombard street within walking distance to the port where you can get the tours to Alcatraz and visit nearby fisherman’s Wharf. We rented a car at the airport and dropped it off at beach street as we were getting on a cruise and this worked out cheaper than taxis. There was free parking at the hotel and once we parked we didn’t use the car until the last morning when we went to visit the Golden Gate Bridge, which is a short drive away.I did observe that all the while we were there (Thursday -Saturday)that there was enough parking for all the guests. Lombard Street is busy so there may be some traffic noise but it wasn’t too bad. We certainly slept well in the comfortable huge bed. The rooms are fine with a nice shower. A light breakfast is available free of charge in the reception area. We arrived around 2 pm and were allowed to check in. We then walked to fisherman’s wharf and spent the rest of the day there and nearby which was very nice, with plenty of dining options ,before walking back (around 30 minutes). On day two we walked to Alcatraz landing,where you get the Alcatraz tour,again around 30 minutes, I highly recommend taking this tour but make sure you book in advance. After Alcatraz we walked to the nearby (10-15 minutes), cable car terminus and took the car to Union square ($7). This was very good and once we arrived we had lunch at the Cheesecake Factory in Macy’s which was on the top floor so a nice lunch with good views. Afterwards we walked to Coit Tower (warning: there was a a few tough hills to negotiate with the one near the tower being particularly hard). This walk also took you through China town and took 30-45 minutes but took us longer as we looked around etc oh and of course we had to rest a few times! Once at the tower ($8 entry) we took the elevator to the top and enjoyed some lovely views of San Francisco. After this we walked to Lombard Street and up the crooked street(it’s steep!). This took about 30-45 minutes. Luckily our hotel was on Lombard street about 20 minutes on (walking) from the the cooked street. A shower and a glass of wine concluded our day. The next morning we drove to the Golden Gate Bridge and parked up ‘this side’ of it. I think it’s around $4 per hour to park although we got there around 6.15 am (jet lag?) so it’s free until 8 am. This was plenty of time to walk across and back. This was a great experience with lovely views. I hope our review of the hotel and what we did is helpful and please feel free to ask any questions.

1125,"Overall this worked well for us. We stayed in a room with 2 queen beds which was cosy but manageable. Rooms are clean.Breakfast is laid out in reception and is a collection only to take back to the room, but it was ok. Coffee/juice/tea, bananas, apples, packaged pastries, croissants and muffins. The staff are all really great - very friendly. This has the feel of a family run business with everyone bought into giving guests a good experience.Parking is limited but adequate for the number of rooms. It is however free which compared to other hotels, saved $25-30 per night on other options we researched.Be aware that it’s not located close to Fisherman’s Wharf or Union square - it was a 30 minute walk to FW ... and an estimated 50 mins Union Square (but we just got an Uber). Also despite being on Lombard street, this isn’t the crooked zig zag part of the street which also isn’t close. The major improvement would better WiFi. Forget about streaming.

1131,"OK: this is a motel on a main road. The rooms are accessed via the car park, so they are very noisy, as the doors are not insulated, and are on the access route to the other rooms so you have to keep the blinds closed all the time unless you want everyone going past looking in. In fact, you cannot open the windows so there is no way of getting fresh air into the room without leaving the door open. The room really needs redecorating and refurbishing in parts. the furniture looks as if it dates from the 70s, and is really showing its age. Clean, but with quite an unpleasant smell of strong products to mask underlying dirt. The TV remote was particularly grubby. The room only has disposable (recyclable?) cups, which is a shame; even cheap B&Bs give you real mugs and glasses. Also, sound insulation is poor; you can't avoid hearing people next door. Plus side: the hosts and staff are friendly and helpful, free wifi (with needs refreshing daily), individual heating/cooling, continental-type breakfast which you pick up from reception (it would have been good to have some jam/honey and yogurt), good bathroom (which needs regrouting), iron, fridge, microwave & coffee maker in the room.

We had apparently picked a very expensive week in San Francisco, so we chose not to pay ridiculous prices for a 4-star hotel.

She gave us an excellent rate for our first night since we had to arrive after 1 a.m. and we thought that was very fair. We much appreciated that.The furnishings are a little tired and could use some updating, but the staff keeps them extremely clean and the bed was very comfortable. We did hear traffic noise. If that bothers you, you might not want to pick this hotel. This didn't bother us at all, since we put in two very hard days of San Francisco sightseeing and were exhausted when we got back.

Continental breakfast included, room has a microwave and fridge, value for money and it is certainly clean and tidy. The inn is located in a great suburb and after spending three nights and day’s exploring SF we both agreed that we felt the safest in the Marina District. Special thank you to Yogi.

1190,"We recently stayed at The Seaside during a 5 night stay in San Fran. This hotel is close to everything, you have plenty of choices with Lombard Street but we chose Seaside for it modern look and its reviews. We were not disappointed. Yogi at the front desk was extremely helpful and cheerful. I have since read some mixed reviews about this place and I have to say, the service is of a high standard. Although Lombard Street is busy, you are a short walk from the beautiful Filmore and Union shopping districts as well as a short walk to the Marina district. We spend a bit of time in both places. Fisherman's wharf is a longer walk but absolutely doable, or you can take an Uber which will only cost you $10 or so. We walked everywhere, a few Ubers out at night and a bike ride from the hotel thanks to the hire store next door. The rooms are spacious and clean, with modern fit outs. We slept four friends in there comfortably. A little more space for luggage would have been helpful but not an issue. Wifi was excellent and although I've seen some poor reviews in terms of breakfast, it was actually a bonus that it was provided. We just grabbed a piece of fruit and headed out, if people want a sit down breakfast then perhaps they should book more than a 3 star motor inn. Our only issue was on our last night when the couple next door decided to make a LOT of noise at midnight until about 3am. The walls are perhaps not as thick as first thought! We soon called Yogi and the noise ceased.

1200,"If I could do 1 star i would. So much to go into so I'll try spare you...owner is rude and shady, husband speaks no english and is left at the front desk sometimes. Owner gets very defensive when asked about rate information and bill details. Not helpful at all when we asked for help regarding transportation and neighborhood information. Lied about how much she charged us and would not discuss/argued about bill. The coffer maker in the lobby was half broken, she would not let me get tea that night and then rang my phone off the hook 10 minutes later saying it was ok (totally confusing). No coffee carraffe in the room, was not replaced when I told her about it missing. Breakfast was sub par, no real cream for coffee just fake cream packets, no butter for the dry pre packaged croissants. Bed was made incorrectly (no bottom sheet, it was made with a top sheet as a bottom sheet) so the feather bed mattress topper slid off the bed. I could go on and on. Its simple. Look elsewhere. I discussed some of the issues with her but she is so mean and combative I finally gave up saying anything to her. She made us feel very unwelcome and uncomfortable ",16-Oct-16,"20    Seaside Inn

1204,"Welcome at the Seaside-motel. By now you found out that hotels in San Francisco are more expensive than expected. Which means that you are checking the various motels on Lombard street.I can tell you that choosing this place is an ok choice. The location is fine: you can rent bikes on the street (the rental location 3 blocks west is 10 usd cheaper per day); and there are public busses on Chestnut which bring you to Fisherman’s Wharf. The expensive tourist hop-on-hop-off bus stops 2 blocks away.From the inside the rooms have been nicely updated; to a decent hotel level. It’s not very spacious; but nothing is in SF. The wifi works, the fridge works and there is a microwave in the room.Tips: if you come by car; you can park for free. But there are more rooms than parking spots.And if you have 1 of the 2 rooms with a window on streetside: eventhough you have double-glass in the window, it is very very noisy. And don’t count too much on breakfast: there is coffee and juice to drink or you can chew on some banana’s, croissants or prepacked rolls.

Excellent transport links, we had a 3 days hop on/off bus pass and the stop was nearby. Traffic noise is quite loud but didn't really bother us. Parking is tight and very limited. Fortunately we got a space and didn't need the car for 3 days so able to just leave it. Good fast wifi. Easy check in and helpful staff. Room wasn't huge but perfectly adequate.

1207,"This hotel was a great start to the beginning of our USA trip. We were greeted warmly by happy staff. Check-in and out was very quick and efficient. Staff were able to answer all questions we asked and we were given all the information we needed about the hotel, places of interest and the surrounding area. The complimentary nightly social wine and live music is a great way to meet and greet other hotel guests from all over the world and share stories of your travels, just a wonderful idea. We loved the quaint and unique décor which makes you feel right at home. The rooms are just like pictured on line, very quaint, clean, and the bed is very comfortable. The bathroom is modern and very clean. Be mindful of: 1) There is no fridge in the room - although not that big of an issue really; and 2) Inconsiderate guests that travel in groups and they have rooms on the same floor, leave their doors to their rooms open and have conversations from room to room, from outside their rooms into the hallways, speaking very loud and at times laughing till late into the night, not realising that there are other guests staying there that can hear all their conversations as well, although this isn't the hotel's fault, guests should be more considerate and respectful to other guests.We would definitely stay here again if we ever return to San Fran.

1223,"Hotel has great character but was lacking in a few areas that I would think would be easily corrected. The Wi-Fi is atrocious; don't rely on it if you need it for work or something else important. They charge you 15 bucks a day for the privilege of using the barely functional Wi-Fi...along with some filtered water and a daily paper.The room was cramped, but a different layout could improve that and add space for more countertop/shelving to place luggage and items. Most of our belongings stayed on the floor. The rooms include a Keurig coffee maker with fantastic coffee pods, but they're chintzy on supplying sugar packets, which seems weird given the rest of the great coffee setup. Our biggest beef was that there is no fridge in the room. Even cheap Motel 6's have a mini-fridge in the room! There is a large closet with a safe and an ironing board and iron, which would be easily big enough for a mini-fridge (or more shelving/countertop space).Complaints aside, the hotel is tastefully decorated, has great character and the staff are all first-rate and very helpful. It was a pleasure to speak with any of them, but Theo in particular was a fantastic ambassador of the hotel and the city overall.

1228,"It's not the fanciest, newest or most deluxe hotel by a long shot, but the Hotel Carlton (a 1920s charmer) is a great value in a screamingly expensive city and with all due respect to SarahFromChicago, it is well located with plenty of nearby sights and conveniences.Where do I start? The staff. What a nice group of people. When we arrive a computer glitch was preventing keys from being programmed so Gianni (Johnny?) swept us and our luggage upstairs and made us comfortable. The desk staff are a delightful bunch who remember you and wave hello and goodbye and do what they can to show they care. Leo (again name?) has actually organized musical events with free wine at cocktail hour--and those bands and singers, musically diverse combos, were a real pleasure and not just a noisy feature.Room 317 had no view at all but that simply didn't matter. It was quiet and comfortable and the cleaning staff were efficient. Unlike several places we have stayed recently, there was no arriving back at 4:00 and finding the room had not yet been tidied. The rooms are modest in size but again--unless you have several people spending a lot of time in the room, just how much space is necessary? The television was decent sized and good quality. The bathroom was efficient and well lit. There was ample space in the closet and several large drawers in the bureau. On every floor is a watercooler and a pitcher in the room makes that a truly nice feature. Oh, and the glasses are actually glass and the coffee cups are ceramic. I can't tell you how pleasant that is. Ice is on the main level as is a microwave should you need one. We used ice daily and the microwave twice. We had not originally planned to have a car, but we ended up borrowing the grandson's car so we could get back and forth--and because the garage on the immediate next corner, really only a hundred feet away has a $25 hotel rate. The staff there are delightful and in the end, this great value saved us a ton on Ubers.Need a Walgreens? It is two blocks away. Want to return your Alamo rental? The service at Union Square is a pleasant 1/2 mile walk. Need a bite? There is a huge range within 1/2 mile and mostly much closer. Common Sage offers Ramen. There's Middle Eastern inside the hotel and across the street. Two blocks further up Sutter is the Slider Diner for those that just want an excellent burger. Next to the hotel is the relaxing Miller's Rest. And my favorite, across Sutter and a few doors down is Le Marais open at 7:30 am with its French pastries (amazing pain aux raisins!) and hot coffee. Light lunches also available. Okay, SF MoMA is perhaps a bit too far to walk but there are busses and there are Ubers. So many Ubers.And the parks and Fine Arts Museums in them are a couple miles away or so, but parking is a headache and public transportation of some kind is a much better choice.The effect is a little shabby chic with a touch of South Asian color and a wee bit of camp. We were entirely happy with it. I would unquestionably stay again and recommend the place highly.",16-May-19,"21    Hotel Carlton, a Joie de Vivre hotel

1237,The hotel has been updated and is very comfortable. It's age shows in some places but it very clean. The internet is fast and there are sufficient convenient power outlets. The beds are excellent. There is plenty of storage space. The staff was friendly and efficient. The wine and music at 5:30 was fun and well attended. It is not in the tourist popular Union Square area - which was ok - but be careful not to wander into the nearby Tenderloin. The restaurant was just so-so. But who cares when the amazing and awesome Mr. Holmes Bakehouse is right around the corner? We attended Hamilton at the Orpheum Theatre and afterward caught a #19 Muni bus from the front of the theatre to 2 blocks from the hotel. Way cheaper and faster than a ride hailing service. My high marks for price are because we got a spring special price. ,16-Apr-19,"21    Hotel Carlton, a Joie de Vivre hotel

1246,"I read a lot of reviews before booking at the Hotel Carlton. Some of the negative comments concerned me but I decided to take a chance because ""the price was right."" We were very pleased with our 3-night stay here. Upon check-in we received a warm and friendly welcome at the front desk (thank you, Theo). Our Deluxe King room was on the seventh floor and faced east toward the Financial District. The room was spacious and clean. The bathroom was spotless. In fact, the tile work and fixtures seemed to be brand new. The bath towels were oversized and absorbent. To address some of the negative comments I'd seen in other reviews: 1) yes, the walls do seem to be thin. On Saturday night of our stay there seemed to be a ""girls getaway weekend"" going on and we did hear voices through the wall. For the next two nights I believe there was a guest in the same room but we didn't hear a peep. 2) The neighborhood. We found the street to be quiet and safe and there were several really great restaurants and coffee shops within a few blocks. Just down the street we stumbled upon Chisme Cantina which was a new discovery to us and so delicious. It was also nice to have a Trader Joe's just a few blocks away to stock up on snacks and drinks. And as you walk up into Nob Hill the neighborhood is full of interesting nooks and crannies to explore.We found the other guests to be friendly and people seemed to enjoy being there.

1285,"I stayed at the Kimpton Buchanan recently for three nights while on a business trip to San Francisco. The hotel is clean and the rooms are a good size, however, it is a bit dated and the rooms feel like they are unfinished. For example, there was no desk and there was no coffee maker. There was a small fridge, however. They did bring me a Keurig machine when I asked about coffee, as there are no coffee shops in the area and I am someone who likes to start my day with a hot coffee. So for me, this is not somewhere that I would return, but it is based more on my personal tastes and needs when I travel and not anything inherently wrong with the hotel or location.",15-Apr-19,"22    Kimpton Buchanan

1292,"I really enjoyed staying at this property a few years ago and looked forward to visiting it again. Just like before, I willingly paid extra for an upgraded patio room - Room 103. In fact, I think I stayed in the same room the last time.Unfortunately, this time the HVAC system was defective. Whenever it would cycle on, approximately 4x/hour, it would make a huge noise. It literally sounded like someone tossing a metal trash can across a concrete driveway. This disruptive noise occurred 24x7.Also, the sliding glass door that opens onto the public patio could not be locked. After the little lever was moved into the locked position, any movement of the door handle or shaking of the door would cause the lock to disengage and become unlocked.The little bedside tables have nifty built-in outlets and USB charging ports. However, the table on one side of the bed contained defective ports - the bedside light worked fine so there was power to the table, but the ports were dead. Of course, my wife didn't notice that until the next morning when she discovered her plugged-in phone did not charge overnight. Lastly, the in-room refrigerator was barely cool... probably no colder than 55 degrees. There was no control knob or other means to adjust the temperature downward. I reported these problems to the front desk staff and the response was, ""Oh, I see... we'll have someone look at it."" The guy didn't take any notes or indicate surprise. I have to believe these things didn't mysteriously fail when I appeared. They were most probably on the maintenance list for a while but were simply ignored.Paying nearly $700 for two nights lodging with these deficiencies is unacceptable. As mentioned above, I stayed in this hotel previously and enjoyed my visit immensely. I wrote glowing reviews about that visit on social media praising the facility and staff.

1310,"Hotel- Kimpton Buchanan (San Francisco, CA) Date: 03jan2019 – 04jan2019Overall: Average. Japantown location. Friendly staff, Limited facilities. Accommodations- Average. We were assigned a Balcony King room. The bedding was enticing & comfortable, and the room contained the usual furniture. Some furniture should be repainted/maintained; the bathroom door had no handle or latch to keep closed. A refrigerator was provided but the usual Kimpton minibar was not present. The heater had limited functionality, only very limited space was available on the bathroom countertop for toiletries. The balcony, bed, & television met expectations. The carpet was in really good shape.Loyalty Program Recognition- Above Average/Very good. As a Kimpton Inner Circle member, my room was upgraded. A welcome amenity of chips, nuts, water, and 2 sodas which was present in the room upon arrival, and we were given branded cloth bags containing water, chips, nuts, & Kind bar, as a substitute for a minibar. No ‘Complementary Chefs Taste’ was applicable.Staff- Excellent. Ed, at the reception, was excellent; he checked us in and explained the hotels amenities and offerings, along with a handout of local stores for food & shopping; Prior to checkout, he helped with printing & faxing service. He was a model employee and deserves special kudos. Emily, the manager, was very kind and professional. The wine hour ‘sommelier’ could not pronounce the wine offerings. For this Kimpton, appetizers did not accompany the wine hour, but two select alcohols were.Housekeeping- Poor. The bathroom was not good. The tub had scum buildup around the sides and bottom, and on the floor at the bottom of baseboards, dirt was accumulating, in part due to flooring choice. A bug was smashed on the ceiling. The carpet appeared clean. Scuffs were present on the walls. The bed was clean in appearance.Pool/Gym: not evaluatedMeal Options-. Average. The restaurant Mums provided the only food and beverage available within the hotel, and no room service is offered. The food is excellent, in price, taste, & service. Unfortunately, not even a menu is available in the room; you must go to the restaurant to even check what is available. It is not a Kimpton restaurant, but can be charged to your room, we were told. A full mall is located across the street, as an alternative, during select hours.Laundry- Poor. No laundry price list was available. Not evaluated further.Computer/Printer/WiFi- Good. WiFi was strong, and video streaming was possible. No computer or printer were available; printing had to be done via emailing the front desk. Property Appearance- Good. Exterior- The building is seasoned. The entrance was inviting; steps leading downward bring you to the lobby & reception. Interior- The lobby was appealing.

1317,"Stayed for two nights in the ""junior suite"". The rooms are small, but comfortable; the elevator -- straight from the 20's -- is charming; the location can't be beat. The more-accomplished-than-one-would-expect mini-murals are, dare I say, delightful :-) They certainly make the exploration of all the floors, and the downstairs, and the two sitting areas into an adventure. We also had a dinner at Jeanne de Arc restaurant in the bowels of the hotel which I will review separately. The minor quibbles are as follows: 1) the hotel has no room service, even for breakfast. I understand it's a bit of hassle, but breakfast hours are a bit short. 2) the ""room+dinner"" special ended up costing $50 more than simply booking a room and having dinner separately. I am not sure what I was expecting, but it was the very same standard prix fixe dinner.3) because they now only offer free breakfasts if the hotel is booked on their website (which is not a great website, by the way, with disappearing and re-appearing specials and unclear availability, but I digress) -- they have a system of little coupons that one must carry to have breakfast for free. It seems that saying your room number should be sufficient and the restaurant should get a daily list of the ""entitled"" rooms.

1322,"In selecting this hotel, I did note the decorated walls and extensive range of artefacts throughout, all emphasising the french theme. Entering the hotel, the décor was initially a little overwhelming, with painted flowers on walls and ceilings everywhere, an enthusiastic homage to French impressionist art and in the restaurant, to Jeanne D’ Arc. Vases with fresh flowers are a welcome touch. The 1910 elevator is a piece of the history of the building. Located in Bush Street, the hotel is convenient to the cable car and it is an easy walk down to Union Square and major galleries. It is close to the Financial, Downtown and Nob Hill districts. There is definitely a French presence in this section of the city: there are restaurants, cafés and the Eglise Nôtre Dame des Victoires nearby. Throughout my stay, I gained a genuine appreciation of the excellent service and practical assistance with local information. This family run boutique hotel is small, cosy and friendly. Tea and coffee making is available in one’s room and downstairs next to the lobby. A comfortable lounge area is convenient to sit in and read the paper. Arriving too early to check in, I left my bags and went walking. On my return, my bags were in my room, my coat in the wardrobe for me.

1325,"Recently stayed at the hotel for 5 days. We booked our rooms on the hotel website, so breakfast was included. The hotel is close to Union Square near the top of Powell Street hill, so there is a very steep, but short walk up to the hotel from Union Square. The available breakfast included French toast, pancakes, eggs or either a cheese or mushroom omelet with hash browns and bacon. There is also fruit, cereal, croissants, cheese and yogurt. The options are the same each day. The hotel is older, but the room have been updated. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Our rooms were clean. We would stay at the hotel in the future. It is a good value if you are looking for a mid-price hotel. ",4-Jun-19,"23    Cornell Hotel de France

I spent five nights here but had to move to Fairmont hotel, a 5 star hotel a block away for the 6th night when I decided too late to add on an extra night. I would give Cornell Hotel de France 9/10 and Fairmont 5/10 for its location and value. Cornell Hotel de France is 15 minutes walk to the convention; passing several coffee shops and eatery on the way as well as the cable car and neighborhood convenience stores are just blocks away.

1328,"Having dined at the lovely Jeanne d'Arc restaurant at this hotel in the past, my husband and I decided to try the hotel, which came highly recommended. We were not disappointed. Our room on the sixth floor, overlooking Bush Street was reminiscent of Paris apartments that dominate the city. The old-style elevator is a treat! In the room, there was a small nook with a table and chairs for a nightcap, and the decor - wall fresques and French paintings- were a lovely touch. The cleanliness of the room and bathroom were impeccable. Most remarkable was how quiet this busy street became at night. We slept very well and heard no noise. Finally, this hotel is centrally located to the tourist mecca, Union Square, and offers an excellent rapport quality-price.

A freshly prepared hot breakfast was included with our stay since we booked directly with the hotel. The coffee is excellent! They even offer gluten free bread for toast.

Our room is extremely clean and the hotel has all of the crucial things I look for--closets, coffee, full body mirror, chargers for both USB-type and plug-type devices on both sides of the bed, and a small table. It's perfect! The bathroom toiletries are all L'Occitane, which I really like--the scent of their shampoo is divine. There is artwork and stylish French-inspired decor everywhere you look and the ceilings/walls are artistically hand painted. Pretty impressive! They also offered valet parking just across the street with ""in-and-out"" privileges at a discounted rate. I've been to many hotels in Europe, North America and Asia.

One caveat, we couldn't control the heat and our room was too warm, but when we asked the front desk sent a fan to our room. With it in the window it brought back memories of France.

The hotel is a climb from Union Square and not as convenient as it may look on a map. Inside the hotel the stairs are steep and the elevator is iffy. At first I thought the dogs (there were at least two while we were there) were neat, but their barking at odd times was annoying. The rooms are heated by a radiator, which I like because it is a great type of heat, but no room controls meant our room in the back was often very cold with no way to warm up with a note telling us not to attempt to adjust. Although the room was advertised with breakfast, it seemed to be a simple coffee and toast affair in a cramped and crowded room.

1368,"We were planning to be in San Francisco for one night during our recent road trip and wanted somewhere clean, safe, and not ridiculously expensive. After reading countless reviews of many properties, we settled on the Coventry Motor Inn and booked a room with 2 beds for our family of 4. The free parking, free WiFi, and location were all extremely appealing. Some reviews mentioned street noise and small rooms, but we weren't bothered by any noise (our room was facing the street and we brought a small white noise machine) and thought the room was very spacious with a separate seating area of a loveseat and a table and chairs. The bathroom came with toiletries and there was a coffee pot/coffee as well. The iron and ironing board worked like a charm. The beds were very comfortable and the room was very clean. The rooms are dated, but it wasn't stuffy or dusty or musty. We appreciated the air conditioning. The men working at the desk when I called prior to our stay and at check in/check out were very friendly. Our room happened to be ready prior to check in time, which was great for us. And they had no problem with us leaving our car until the evening on the day we checked out while we continued exploring the city. The Coventry Motor Inn was a very pleasant surprise and we would absolutely recommend it and stay here again for sure. We thought it deserved all the good reviews and was even better than a lot of them made it seem!",10-Jul-19,"24    Coventry Motor Inn

If you're traveling to SF this summer be aware that some hotels do not have air conditioning. Coventry HAS air conditioning but does not serve breakfast.

1374,"If you're looking for a good value and a good location in the city, here is your spot. We stayed here for three days and it served as a good jumping off point for sight seeing each day. The rooms are 'standard', but they get the job done. There is a separate table and chairs to sit at, so you don't have to sit on the bed all the time, which I appreciate. I would say the rooms could use a couple more outlets for charging purposes though. I travel with a power strip, so I was fine.As far as location goes, this hotel has FREE PARKING, which in the city is a plus! We left our car here and took a Lyft to the tourist areas most days, and due to the central location, each ride was less than $10...way less than the parking fees down at Pier 39, etc. In all, I would recommend staying here...I'd do it again.",23-Apr-19,"24    Coventry Motor Inn

1375,"It’s not entirely clear to me how this place gets so many good reviews. I can only assume that they bought them. It is basically a motel with zero facilities and character to match. When I got out of the lift on my floor there was a funky smell which may or may not have been caused by the huge stain coming from underneath one of the vending machines there. This smell was still evident in my room. It faded over the days but I may just have got used to it.The room itself was OK. It was dark and outdated but the bed was comfortable enough and the WiFi worked well. In the bathroom the shower pipe came out of the wall at an odd angle which made showering a bit awkward.The real problem with the place, however, seems to be the management. When I attempted to negotiate a late checkout, the manager became rude and aggressive and could not have been less accommodating. In the end he suggested I should check out there and then. I couldn’t believe my ears. I have never been spoken to in such a way by any hotel staff. Not content with being a miserable jobsworth in person the manager chose to follow up on this by putting a nasty little note under my door the next morning. He also attempted to ruin my day by refusing to store my bag. How petty!! Fortunately, the hotel next door was happy to oblige.There never seemed to be many people around so I imagine that the place is on its last legs financially. I intend to help it on its way by never staying there again and I suggest you do the same.",21-Apr-19,"24    Coventry Motor Inn

1377,"Clean, spacious room, although a bit drab, as reported by other reviewers. The bed is very comfortable; nice big t.v., hair dryer, toiletries, drip coffee pot and coffee, iron and ironing board are in the room. We arrived probably an hour or so before check-in time of 3:00, and they did not hesitate to allow us to check-in early. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The location is very safe and just a couple of blocks to several restaurants. We ate breakfast both mornings at Mel’s Diner, just down Lombard Street. The hotel is in walking distance to the curvy part of Lombard Street, but I would recommend against walking (uphill) to it; catch a cable car to it from Fisherman’s wharf, instead, and walk (downhill) back to the hotel. My husband and I are in good shape, and it’s not the distance but the crazy incline of that section of Lombard street that will challenge you. We took an Uber to catch the ferry one morning, and it was about $10, I believe. You could certainly walk it, but we opted ride to insure that we got there on time...stress-free. Our room faced Lombard street, and the traffic noise was loud in the evening but quieted by the time we were settling in to sleep. I would certainly recommend this hotel for your stay in San Francisco. The hotel has a good size parking garage attached, but we did not have a vehicle.",11-Apr-19,"24    Coventry Motor Inn

It was about 2 blocks to a bus stop, which we used rather than trying to park in various places. Bed was very comfortable. Cable quit working, due to equipment issues in building, so we were without a TV for 1/2 of our stay. Furnishings and decor looked to be from the 80s. One main draw was the free parking, which is difficult to come by. We chose the free parking over a place that had free breakfast. It seemed a little high still, for what it was, but it wasn't bad.

We were also around 10 minutes walk from Greens Restaurant which is a delicious vegetarian restaurant. We were able to travel on buses - the stops were a few minutes walk away - into town. It took about 20 - 30 minutes. I thought the area in which the hotel was located was excellent and felt safe, even when walking around at night.

1384,"I stayed here for a few nights during the end of the year. The hotel does not serve breakfast, but does have free parking! I searched extensively but free parking is a rarity in San Francisco. Location: There is a good restaurant nearby where you can get great breakfast, it’s called Mel’s diner and is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel. As an added bonus, this diner has the retro diner feel as you would see in some movies. The famous Lombard street is a 30 minute walk (partly uphill). You can get to the golden gate park with Lyft or Uber for around 16$. I wouldn’t recommend driving yourself in San Francisco due to the high parking prices and break-ins are a real danger in San Francisco. From the Golden Gate Bridge you can take bus 28 which will take you in 10-15 minutes to the hotel. Tickets for this bus can be purchased via the “muni” app (2.50$ for a ride) or via the driver (2.75$ per ride). Even fishermans wharf is a 30-35 minute walk. The hotel staff: Mo of the front desk was very friendly and helpful. Other staff members were also very friendly. Nothing to complain about that!The lobby is essentially located in the first floor of the parking garage, but there is also an underground floor. I read some reviews complaing about the parking garages being very narrow. However with our SUV Jeep Cherokee parking was quite easy. The room itself: the rooms and the hotel are a little old, but well maintained and propely cleaned. The airconditioning/heating might sometimes make a little noise, but nothing too major. You can easily sleep through it. The beds were also very comfortable!The price: the price might seem steep for a hotel, but if you look at the price level of hotels in San Francisco, this price is almost the lowest you can get for a decent hotel. On top of that there is free parking which will cost you around $60 per day in other hotels!",6-Jan-19,"24    Coventry Motor Inn

1389,"We stayed here recently during our quick trip through the Bay area. We chose Coventry based on the reviews, the value pricing and our desire to explore the neighborhoods a bit more than just frequenting tourist spots and union square. We typically stay in nicer chain hotels but decided to try something different this time. The skinny: the hotel is decent but no frills, clean and well maintained for sure but make no mistake - definitely budget so it depends if this is for you. It was a reasonable experience overall for us but definitely marred by the check-in experience. After a long drive from the central coast, we were tired but grateful to be in SF. However the front-desk staff, a crusty old gentleman by the name of 'Vince' literally growled at us when we appeared for check-in. He was literally cursing under his breathe as he checked us in and could not have made us as guests feel more uncomfortable, we were glad to be done with him. Courtesy note to management - attitude makes all the difference in the world, please staff the front desk with individuals who actually care about service. Note to Vince - if you don't like people please do not work in the hospitality industry, simple as that. Fortunately, there all kinds and stripes in this world and the rest of the staff we bumped into during our trip from housekeeping to when we checked out were pleasant and courteous. We enjoyed our few days in SF, the location of Coventry Inn is quite good and you are only blocks from Chestnut street which has plenty of dining and shopping choices.

1407,"We were on the top floor of Coventry Inn staying late May 2018 when we discovered a bedbug. The mattresses are double covered in mattress protectors, so you would not be able to tell unless you spent an hour taking out the mattress. They deducted $50 from our stay and put our clothes through their commercial dryer. When I asked how they would get rid of the bed bugs, they said they do a deep clean of all rooms every couple months. Only serious heat and fumigation will get rid of bed bugs.

1408,"We stayed two nights in a 2 queen room with sofa. We chose this property in large part due to the free parking for our rental car. We arrived before check-in for our first night (around noon). Mo graciously allowed us to park early so we could attend a Giants game. He also extended our parking time period for after our check-out because our flight departed late that night. Both of these gestures were greatly appreciated. We liked how our room was laid out, nice bathrooms, and extra seating. We were able to use the Muni very easily from a block or less walk from the property. However, we had a broken commitment about our room request. Mo had arranged, per our request at booking time, to have a room away from Lombard St due to noisiness. Upon arrival, pre-check-in time, there was a room scheduled to be available that fit that criteria but still being cleaned. We were promised we would get that room and not room 315 which was on the corner facing Lombard St. When we returned around 7, we were given room 315 by Vince since it was the only room left. Room 315 was incredibly noisy from the street traffic, and not even earplugs could completely block it out. This room needs to have a white noise or other background sleep noise machine. You can request a room away from Lombard St, but be sure to arrive promptly at check-in time for the best chance to get it.",1-Jun-18,"24    Coventry Motor Inn

We used uber everywhere and when we ordered a car it would Leah’s take less than a 5 mins for the car to arrive. Decor is abit old but for the price you pay and the time spent In your room it is a bargain. Spoke to the front desk and they informed us that they have recently replaced all their beds.

We were early for check in, but they checked our bags, and off we went. Back to the bus stop and a five minute ride, we were at the wharf. And a very easy return. The rooms were a little dated, but clean and roomy. There were not a lot of amenities, but that's not why we were in San Francisco. This is mostly a residential area so it was pretty quiet.

We had seen it on previous visits, but we’re pleasantly surprised at how centrally located it is. It’s a small boutique hotel, and does not serve breakfast, although there’s coffee in the lobby in the mornings and a wine happy hour in the late afternoon. However, one of our favorite bakeries/breakfast and lunch places, La Boulangerie, is literally across the intersection from the hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful, both at check-in and when we had requests afterwards. They also have a “joyfully green” program, where there is partial service to help conserve energy (and really,who needs their room vacuumed every day?) which we opted for most days. We did have an inside room, meaning that it opened on the atrium and did not have street noise, and we heard someone at the desk asking to be moved, so perhaps it’s important to request an inside room.

1457,"When I arrived at the hotel after a long day travelling, it was the best feeling ever! The warm welcome and cosy reception was just what we were looking for. The location was brilliant - The hotel was really close to the metro stop for the train from the airport and there was a supermarket just over the road. There was also an Amazon Go store round the corner, which my husband was excited about! It's also within walking distance of China Town and Union Square, including the stops for the cable car and sightseeing bus. There did seem to be a lot of homeless around but think that's a problem everywhere in San Francisco.The receptionists were so friendly, really helpful with any questions we had and always said hello / goodbye as we arrived / left. Another highlight was wine hour every day! We missed it when we first arrived and they sent some wine up to the room. There was also free tea and coffee available in the mornings. The room on the small side but the bed was so comfy. Unfortunately, I had requested for no feather bedding due to allergies and we had feathers when we arrived. Although they did sort it out quickly. The room was a bit dusty in places and it was noisy with traffic and people so take you ear plugs! The wifi was good and there were lots of plugs for charging things! Nice touch with a torch in the room. There was a safe & a lovely big shower with nice cosmetics!There's a nice garden & walking track in the hotel but we didn't use it.There was a room tax but I think it's reasonable considering the pros of the hotel. Would definitely stay here again.",24-May-19,"25    Galleria Park Hotel

1464,"I booked a twin room and requested a rollaway bed for our party of three 3 months prior to arrival through Expedia. Upon arrival after a long flight from the UK, I was told they could not accommodate the rollaway bed in a twin due to fire regulations - which I accept. However, they could see my request on their system yet no-one thought to contact me so that I could make alternative arrangements. Instead they told me that I would have to book a separate room - effectively doubling what I had already paid. It was their error, which they admitted and were apologetic, however to expect a customer to just pay for a second room on he spot due to their error is absolutely unfair. They were not willing to offer any discount except waive the resort fee for the room. The whole situation caused so much stress and ruined the first day of our trip - that we had been looking forward to for months. I cancelled my booking with them and booked an Airbnb instead. Was probably the same price as two rooms but I didn’t want to give Galleria Park Hotel my money out of principle.",21-Apr-19,"25    Galleria Park Hotel

Being in the business district it felt a bit quiet at night on the weekends but it was still a good location and easy to navigate to and from. Upon our arrival they were just finishing up cocktail hour in the lobby and offered us a drink as we checked in. The hotel was nicely decorated and had a comfortable lobby space with chairs and tables, perfect when meeting up with friends staying in different rooms. Housekeeping did a nice job every day as well. I would recommend this hotel.The only thing I would say wasn't fantastic was the size of the room and bathroom - super small but when I looked at the floor map it appeared that our room was among the smallest on the floor. Also, we were on the 8th floor but still could hear lots of outside noise (garbage and recycling handling) in the early hours.

As you all know the steep hills of San Fran can be tough and this hotel is located on one.Check in was amazing Michael at the front gave me a great room over looking the garden.

1482,"The Fairmont San Francisco is a beautiful hotel conveniently located. We stayed in a double bed room which was quite nice with good sized rooms and bathrooms. However, for what you pay for a room here you'd think what I would call ""standard"" amenities would be included (e.g. WiFi and fitness facility access). Instead, both these costs extra which I think is ridiculous.Also annoying was the fact that it took quite some time for the water to get hot in the bathroom, and the faucet in the sink was set too far back in the sink bowl.  You couldnt even wash your hands without hitting the back of the sink bowl. This could easily be remedied with a longer spout on the faucet. I also found it surprising that the front desk didn't have an Ethernet cable available when we asked.  My kids wanted to hook up their Xbox and this required an Ethernet cable to access the hotel's sign in page (you couldn't access the sign in page on wifi with the Xbox). Further, the bell man at front didn't give proper advice on Uber stops for getting to the start of the Golden gate bridge, which resulted in us paying more than we needed to for the Uber. I know this couldn't have been the first time someone asked where to stop in order to walk across the GG bridge.  So overall a nice hotel, but for the money I would expect the ""extras"" and better knowledge from the bell service.",2-Jul-19,"26    Fairmont San Francisco

When I went down to get assisted by the concierge, Payal was ready, willing to assist and was amazing. She made some recommendations and booked some excursions for us.The following time we needed services of the concierge and we made contact with the legendary Mr. Thomas Wolfe, wow! what a gentleman. The passion for his role reflects in the way he deals with guests, making each guest feel important /special and attention to detail and the professionalism of his communication and feedback is worth mentioning. All I can say to those working in his team, WATCH and LEARN!The fact that the hotel has a complimentary car service to transport within San Fran puts this hotel above its competitors/to another level, yes I know its based on"" first come, first serves' or availability but its available for guests to use it and we managed to use it when we really needed it.Then, the nightly wine down was just a great treat and the beautiful way of ending your day before going out for the evening or dinner, although, I would recommend a variety in wines but the cheese platters were amazing with good quality product. some locally sourced. The rooms were serviced daily by friendly and attentive staff however I was disappointed that a hotel of this caliber didn't have a turndown services and hotel slippers. Furthermore, if you are going to provide your guest with complimentary tea and coffee ( NB: great tea selection and coffee) , it would make sense to also provide them with complimentary water.Lastly, you really need to look at your breakfast selection and how its served. We had breakfast at the hotel only once and the other days we opted for eating out. The cost of it, is really not worth what it is served.

1484,"The Fairmont is a beautiful, historic hotel built in 1907. The location in Nob Hill is very nice and centrally located. We stayed in a junior suite in the main tower. It was beautiful and had a large sitting room with pull-out couch (the kids said it was comfy for sleeping) and a separate master bedroom with a king bed. The balcony was spacious with 4 chairs and overlooked the rooftop garden. The bathrooms are small but they placed a nice storage tower in the corner and the closet nearby is spacious. The lobby is all marble and very beautiful. We ate breakfast in the hotel each morning. The buffet is $35 for adults and $17 for children. They also have a kids menu with items around $8. Buffet is pretty standard... omelet station, pancakes, bacon, sausage, bagel/toast, pineapple, cantaloupe and strawberries. Be sure to have a drink or meal in the Tonga room on the lower level. We didn't eat there so I can't speak to the food, but it is a unique, fun experience. What used to be the hotel pool decorates the middle of the room and a ""thunderstorm"" happens inside the restaurant every 15 minutes or so. It is decorated like a ship with a Hawaiian theme.Also, check out the rooftop garden. There is corn hole and beautiful flowers as well as some nice couches to sit and enjoy the weather and views.Getting around from the hotel: It is too far to walk to the main tourist attractions, however both lines of the cable car have a stop next to the hotel. For $12 you can purchase a MUNI pass on your phone and ride the cable car unlimited for the day. An uber will cost between $6 to $15 each way to some of the ""main spots"" like Lombard, Little Italy, Pier 33 for Alcatraz, Fisherman's wharf, California museum, and the Presido beach area. There is also a Hertz rental car desk inside the hotel but be aware parking is $75 a night.

1489,"The hotel is a landmark. It’s beautiful inside. The room(s) we had were clean and comfortable, but boy.... for being a “4-5 star hotel,” this was one of the most disappointing experiences I’ve ever had. Pros: Clean, super friendly staff, good and timely food from room service. And that’s about it. We love the history of the hotel, and Nob Hill is a great location. Cons: 1st room - the AC didn’t work. It took hours before someone finally came up to check it out. The mechanic that came up was very nice and helpful. It was mainly the fact that the front desk kept telling us they would call us back. Meanwhile, our room was 80 degrees and stifling. We called several times before my fiancé had to get very stern. Finally that’s when the mechanic came up. They ended up moving us to an upgraded room, which sufficed. 2nd room - After hours of walking around San Francisco’s hilly roads, we come to our room to find that our keys are not working. We sit in the hallway by the elevators for about ten minutes after speaking with the front desk. A guy comes up with two new keys, not very apologetic, and tries to open our room with the new keys they made. Surprise, surprise.. these keys aren’t working either. “If my key doesn’t work, I’ll have to get engineering to come check it out.” Really? And what should we do? Sit in the hallway and wait? Like WTH. Sweet guy from engineering comes up, changes battery, and keys still won’t work. So we are stuck sitting here. Front desk could seriously take some customer service manner lessons from the engineering department. Those guys were apologetic and tried to be so accommodating. For the amount of money we spent, I just expect the bar to be raised. If I’d spent a few hundred less per night, this kind of stuff happening, combined with the front desk’s lack of hospitality would have been expected. When you spend money to stay in a place like this, you expect the highest level of service, and that’s just not what we felt we received. Again, the guys from engineering were the best part of the customer service that we received. One more thing - the first room we had, had amazing shower and water pressure. The second, which was a suite, had the worst water pressure ever. They had a little sign in the bathroom about low water pressure shower heads and preserving water. I am ALL FOR preserving our resources and not wasting water, but my showers took twice as long because I could barely rinse the soap from the hair. Just another thing that was annoying and made no sense. So, as beautiful as the hotel is, the rich history, and cleanliness, next time we come to San Fran, we will be looking at another hotel.

They moved us to 5th floor with roughly the same size. We were just so tired to request another upgrade and just ended up sleeping instead.

1492,We spent 4 nights here while visiting the wonderful city and had an awesome time. When we arrived at the hotel it was in lock down with secret service everywhere. It was the same the next day when we arrived back after an exhausting day exploring the city's delights. Apparently the Polish President was also staying at the Fairmont - if it's good enough for him then it's good enough for us. Check in was very easy and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was very comfortable and spacious. We had a walk-in wardrobe. The bathroom was a little on the small side with the shower over the bath. The room was spotless and we had a reasonable but restricted view of the bay. There was a very good selection for breakfast with a choice from the buffet or from the menu but expensive. We also availed of the restaurant in the evening. I don't normally like to single out an employee but one waiter called Rami in the restaurant was exceptional. We received VIP treatment from him every time we dined there. The hotel is located at the top of the famous Nob Hill (which we walked up twice) and all 3 cable car routes stop outside it. It is close to China Town and the Union Square shopping centre but about 3 and a half miles from Fisherman's Wharf - all down hill. We would definitely stay at the Fairmont again.,22-Jun-19,"26    Fairmont San Francisco

1495,"I am still processing the experience of staying here. We upgraded from a queen/queen room to a main building balcony suite upon check in. Initially things were great. The balcony really is beautiful and quite large. However, the first night we were awoken at 1am by the sound of the guests in the adjoining room having incredibly loud intimate relations. I was shocked by how much we could hear through the wall. I called down to make a noise complaint and was told they would send someone up to knock. I have no idea if that happened but approximately 5min later we could hear the phone ringing in their room, and again 10min after that. Once again, it essentially sounded as if we were in the same room as them. We eventually fell back asleep but again, at 7am the next morning, could clearly hear the guests next door engaged in the same activity. At that point I called down and requested to be moved to a different room immediately. I wasn't particularly impressed with how the hotel handled the situation. They made it seem like they were doing us a favor by allowing us to move rooms. I appreciate the fact that they cannot control who stays in adjoining rooms, however the original price of a balcony suite is almost $800/night. The walls are basically paper thin. And it wasn't as if the room next door was playing music, we had to listen to strangers having sex. I hate to think of what would have happened if a child was staying in our room. We were eventually moved to a tower suite. We had no issues with with noise after moving and the views were quite nice.In addition to the noise issues, when we checked out I was told I had a balance owing of $900. I found this confusing as I had paid in full when I booked (through the Fairmont website). The woman at the front desk informed me that it was my room upgrade charges...however it shouldn't have been anywhere near $900. I paid the bill because we had to get to the airport but when I arrived home I called the hotel to get some clarity. I had to speak to three different employees (none of whom could explain the charges) until I was connected with the Assistant Rooms Division Manager. She also could not explain the charges and asked me to send her a email with my original booking. Within 24hrs, she had replied that it was an error on their end and they have overcharged me by over $300 (!). As a gesture of goodwill they refunded my destination fee ($30/night). I was shocked that such a situation could happen, and if I hadn't been persistent about the incorrect charges, I would have had to pay!The hotel itself is very beautiful and the location is great. I had read rave reviews of the customer service at the Fairmont San Francisco, unfortunately I didn't experience any of it. I would recommend taking a close look at your bill upon checking out.",19-Jun-19,"26    Fairmont San Francisco

1504,"We stayed in this hotel from 13th to 17th of April 2019 in two signature king tower rooms with panoramic view. The hotel used to be of a high standard maybe ten years ago, however it is not the case now. To begin with, we were checked in with over an hour delay to one room and even with more delay to our second room. Thus, after a long flight from London, UK, we had to wait in a lobby for additional 1.5 hrs. Not a good start, I must say! Secondly, the hotel itself leaves a biter impression of warn out/outdated building, with dirty windows (there was no point really for us to pay extra for panoramic view for that reason). Room service at night? Not in Fairmoint, unfortunately. All of the above is far from what you expect from 5* hotel. But what was the most surprising yet disappointing is they way how management handled our complain: in a defensive, aggressive manner as if we had no right to ask for a slippers in the room, cup of tea at 1 am or were meant to sit in a lobby past check in deadline. AccorHotels had definitely lowered the bar and made one of the formerly best hotels in SF below average yet it cost a fortune. ",10-Jun-19,"26    Fairmont San Francisco

1506,"This was our second stay at the lovely Fairmont San Francisco, perched atop Nob Hill, just to the north of Union Square, but sitting above it. We were back in San Francisco for a series of business meetings for my wife, and predicated on our previous stay in March, we returned in November, before heading to London for more meetings. We are also Fairmont Gold members, so there are usually a few nice “perks,” from the hotel chain.We arrived in the early afternoon, and checked in. We were assigned Room 1006.The Hotel:This Fairmont Hotel is located 950 Mason St, and sort of “overlooks” the City of San Francisco, and down toward Union Square. It is an wonderfully elegant building, both inside and out, and harkens to a more glorious time for travel. “Opulent” is the first word, which comes to my mind. While it is an historic hotel, it has been refurbished, and modernized in many ways, so while basically older, it does not lack for the accouterments that one expects from a luxury hotel nowadays. One of those accouterments is the in-room tablet, which control several functions in the room, and also acts as a “personal concierge” service for the hotel, and near-by dining and entertainment.We got to see many things, which we had missed on our previous stay.Room 1006:Room 1006 had an entrance foyer, a very comfortable King bed, with nice pillows (an issue for me, at so many hotels), a nice bathroom w/ walk-in shower (ideal for my wife, with two artificial hips) and a soaking tub, but only a single sink, with small horizontal flat space around it. The small sink/vanity area was one of the few weaknesses in the room. There was a desk, and chest-of-drawers, with a large, flat-screen TV. The décor was “turn of the previous century elegant,” but the furniture was much, much newer, and in great shape. While not the most spacious room we have had, it was more than adequate, and would have been comfortable for a much longer stay.Our view was different this time, but still lovely, and probably one of the most impressive aspects of the view, was the tower section of the Fairmont.We had more than ample storage areas (remember, this was a very short trip/stay), and could easily have accommodated a week’s worth of clothing. We had a safe, iron and ironing board, and a full compliment of Rose 31 amenities in the bathroom. This is the standard Fairmont line of bath amenities, and we find them very nice.We had plenty of AC outlets, and most were near horizontal surfaces, so plugging in a handful of devices, for charging, was easy.Room 1006 was very quiet (as was the entire property), and we heard zero noise from either the outside (even with the California Cable Car Line beside the building), or inside the hotel. The air conditioning system was very quiet too.The Property:As this was in early November, the lobby still had some of the Halloween pumpkins (including some from the employees’ pumpkin-carving contest), but the hotel was transitioning to Christmas, and a “dine-in” gingerbread house was being constructed in the lobby. Even in the transitional state, the common areas were lovely.We printed out our boarding passes for our upcoming flight at one of several computer stations in the lobby, and my wife got to do some shopping on-property, at the various retail stores, just off of the grand lobby.Roof-top garden was lovely..During our brief stay, we had the opportunity to dine on property, and also visit the bar off of the lobby.The Location:The Fairmont is located atop Nob Hill. which can be a bit steep, depending on where one is coming from..On this stay, we did not use any transportation to/from the hotel, beyond our driver taking us from/to SFO for flights, but on the past stay, the doorman always got my wife a taxi, within moments. Due to its proximity to two other major hotels, there are plenty of taxis on Nob Hill, and good Uber/Lyft service too.Conclusion:We had but few interactions with staff, but each was excellent, as the staff was friendly, welcoming and fulfilled our every need.In summary, this was a wonderful, though albeit too short stay, and I am just glad that my wife finally had the time to explore this grand property. We will be returning.",7-Jun-19,"26    Fairmont San Francisco

We couldn’t think of another historic hotel quite as extraordinary. The history added another layer of interest and attraction for us. The staff are superb and really do fit the style of hotel as an excellent historic property used to royalty, politicians and so forth. The only downside is the coffee shop downstairs is really subpar. Disposable cups, no toast for breakfast, overly sweet pastries on small plates that are really saucers for tea cups, plastic cutlery and no napkins whatsoever..... really trashy for a 5 star hotel.

First, the windows in the rooms barely opened, and in my second room, the window operation was cracked and broken. Paint is chipped everywhere, the rooms are worn, and the walls are paper thin. In the morning, I had called down to the front desk/housekeeping for a dental kit as I had misplaced my toothbrush and it took over 20 minutes and 3 calls just to get one sent up. Outlets didn't work and even lightbulb not changed.It is unfortunate as it used to be my location! And I have Gold Accor Status, and love earning points at Fairmont.

Location is ideal for visiting the city. 2 of the cable car lines have stops right near the hotel or it’s a half hour (max) walk down the hill to the bay. For a top end hotel however, it was disappointing that there is no free WiFi in the rooms. The lobby does have WiFi that lasts for a day. All the staff are lovely & helpful and the room was clean & services well. We did splash out on room service on the first night as we arrived late evening. Although they didn’t have the pasta option I had chosen, an alternative was offered. The food arrived in a reasonable time and was hot. On our last day we were able to leave our luggage safely while we went out until it was time to leave. We ordered the airport shuttle that is advertised by link on the website & on the Fairmont ipaddevice in the room. That was a poor experience as the shuttle is a minibus which has seen better days. The driver seemed rushed and had multiple collections which we had planned poorly. We circled back on ourselves several times downtown & it was packed. The seats were small & we were squashed in. The seat belts were a revelation! Definitely stick to Uber next time. We paid $48 coming from the airport plus tip. The shuttle was $38 for the 2 of us.

The front desk on arrival, and the concierge when we asked about a concert were indifferent, the only time the front desks ears picked up was when I informed then on the day we left that we had observed a take away container with left over food at the top on the fire exit stairs visible through the glass door when we arrived and it was still there 7 days later! We did have one breakfast in the restaurant, which was OK if you think $28 for continental buffet is good value, maybe it is for San Francisco. The room, we had one on the mezzanine; was comfortable, it had half a window which was ok, but as with any city with low floors you do get noise, including feeling the vibration from what I suspect were the cables for the cable cars when they start up at approx. 6am we had no need for an alarm, maybe I was sensitive to it.

Quite frankly, the service in this hotel is below their standard and charges.

Even if not used, you are penalized for the heavy overheads in this hotel.The check-in experience was also very bad. We arrived late around 23.00h and finally after visiting the 3rd option room we were satisfied. The guy at the reception was really bad and not helpful at all.

Service was good, seating was plentiful and the venue is attractive. There were two Easter brunches as well, we did not attend either. There was also an egg hunt that looked cute but our kids are way too old sadly. Our rooms were on the 6th floor and had beautiful views of the Bay (I think) Bridge, city and the water. Comfy beds, nice decor. The hotel is older and I did hear noise from the hallway on a few occasions though the hotel tries to encourage a 'quiet time' from 10pm to 8 am. The location of the hotel is excellent as far as I am concerned and if you like to walk, it is at the top of a STEEP hill. The hill top is spectacular with a darling park, historic church and several stately older building. A respite from some of the seedier and busier parts of the city. The trolly is right there to take you up and down the hill and other BART stops. We used Uber for the most part and never had to go much further than 15 minutes. We have stayed in other areas and find this location to be much more pleasant than the hotels in the downtown area. We would definitely choose The Fairmont or also The Ritz over other locations in the city.",1-May-19,"26    Fairmont San Francisco

1531,"I booked the Green Tortoise Hostel for a one-night stay for $47. It’s best to book on their website as not all travel sites have access to their full inventory. The place is a very social & party headquarters, so this may not be the best selection for those expecting to get quality sleep every night. At check-in payment with credit card incurs a $1fee/night, so best to pay cash or use a debit card. There is a $20 key return deposit upon check-in. There are multiple bed rooms, so inquire for a room with fewer (4 vs 8) beds. Guests tend to be under 30 yrs. old. It is a non-smoking facility. **The reception is located on the second floor and there are no elevators. One thing that really impressed me was their info corner. This corner offered one of the best cheat sheets of TO DO/TO GO lists of any property I have ever stayed and this includes five star hotel properties. These little sheets, for example, listed FAQ’s, local foods, local coffee shops, local bars, a brewery list, and more. Each little sheet was pre-cut, so you could just grab it and go. The sheets listed hours for the businesses, clientele, mapped the area, favorite items to purchase at these businesses along with price categories. A simple idea, but excellent information source for all guests.Room:The rooms were probably a bit more dated, but still comfortable. The 4-bunk rooms were tight, but functional. Beds come with a reading light, power outlet, large storage area for each unit under the bunks. I was able to get my large suitcase under the bunk, just remember to bring your own lock. Linen is provided. I happen to be in a co-ed room.Amenities:Free Wi-Fi, free breakfast (07.30-10), pool tables/games, entertainment, lobby massage chairs, huge ball-room, computer lounge, laundry room, community kitchen and fridge storage, coffee/tea, and numerous free dinner nights in the community kitchen during the week. Check the activities board for numerous events each night of the week in-house and around the city. There is a sauna for guests by request only.Overall, the place is a bit more dated and the rooms can be cramped but the hostel certainly offers one of the best activity calendars of any of the SF hostels I have booked in the past. The staff is efficient and very friendly. More mature guests may want to take into account the youthful activities and events and may want to consider other hostels.",30-Apr-19,"27    Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco

1532,Stayed at this place in Feb 2019. Really liked location. Very nearby from Chinatown and Fisherman’s wharf. Close to most party places. Staff is great and helpful. Any questions you have just ask on front desk. Liked the idea of san Francisco landmarks and instructions to reach there. As a traveler you want to keep those info handy.Rooms are good with clean bed and sheets. Clean washrooms. Every evening new activity. Very nice ball room to hangout and eat. Pool table is an additional fun.Only drawback was kitchen utensils hygiene. Probably when I was there the washing area tap was not fixed properly. Utensils were all sticky even after wash. If you provide free food then can make sure utensils are neat and clean. Apart from this i would say this is one of the best place to stay if you visiting SFO.,17-Feb-19,"27    Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco

1533,"I stayed at Green Tortoise for four days. I chose a hostel as I was travelling solo after a long time and wanted people around me. As a working professional I also wanted a place where I could work or use the computer if I wanted to. Green Tortoise was the perfect choice. The staff, like 70% of the people who choose to stay there were quite young. And very friendly. As there is no elevator,they helped me carry my luggage up. Then about the rooms,the dorms have bunk beds and a washbasin too. The basin is quite useful as you can use it when the common washrooms-cum-showers are occupied. The rooms are fairly neat, but the overall infrastructure is a bit old. They have fun themes on different nights. You get free breakfast everyday and on some nights too. If you buy food, you can label and refrigerate in their fridge. Bottom shelves usually have free food you can eat anytime of the day. It can range from salads and meal boxes to leftover cooked the night before. Location wise too it's quite central and has Italian restaurants around. They let me pack free food in their boxes and take it when I had to rush for a tour. They also have massage chairs and a dry sauna room that you can use for free. I felt a little grown up for bunk beds and the very young vibe, but also happy I stayed here as it was hassle free and super friendly. Would surely stay again. They also have a discounted shuttle service to the airport.",13-Feb-19,"27    Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco

1537,"I've been here three times. Once in 2014, once in 2015, and once more in 2018. Good times were had each time. They really are delightful, very social and friendly, and very clean. People from all over the world stay here. They have many options for stays that include private rooms, dorms, triples, etc. They also do dinners every monday wednesday and friday that people are encouraged to help prepare and then everyone gets to enjoy regardless. I'm something of a picky eater, so I didn't have much of these dinners, but it's still a lovely way to get people to gather. Their cook, who gives speeches during the dinners, is quite a character. They are really nicely located, you can walk straight to the piers and the Exploratorium(which I love) pretty easily. Pier 39 and 41 are a distance away, though. Some good pizza is a few blocks away and there is a place that makes excellent wings that is close enough to deliver. Just all around excellent. They have some policies that are kind of annoying but also make sense, like not allowing food or drink in the rooms. Bathrooms are a bit packed in the mornings. Regardless, a beautiful place in a beautiful city. Recommend any day of the week. Five stars! ALL THE STARS. (I only give a four on service because of some less than ideal experience with the cleaning lady not coming back to clean our room when we said we'd be out in five minutes.

It's expected that you will have be adapt to the others in your room (people in and out, moving things around, snoring, etc.). It's probably best to bring earplugs. My belongs felt secure and safe as they have lockers under the bed.

1556,"I stayed at the Green Tortoise a few years ago and had an awesome experience. I’ve since recommended it to lots of friends and family and they have all stayed. So when I had two nights in SF I straight away booked here again. We had a rough day and our two flights were delayed and we arrived at the hostel just after 2am (I had emailed the staff to let them know in advance) we arrived to the hostel and got our bags inside and my partner waited at the bottom of the stairs as I went to check in. As soon as I got to the top of the stairs I was yelled at by the receptionist “don’t kick our doors”....I was baffled and told her I hadn’t done anything to the door other then bump it with my large suitcase. Which she snapped back “you kicked it, I watched you!”. We were off to a great start and it only got worse. The receptionist VELL was rude, condescending, and incredibly unwelcoming. She snapped at me for asking her legitimate questions and gave sarcastic remarks. At this point my partner (who was down the bottom of the stairs) heard the way she was speaking to me and came up. He was also greeted with the same foul attitude. After snapping at us and taking my payment she said “room 36, go right, left, right” and threw the keys on the counter. No explanation of the facilities or perks this hostel offers. Then the following morning we were leaving early (5am) and the same staff member was sitting at the desk...scowling at us as we walked past, not so much as a smile or hello. We have been traveling all over the States and Canada for 12 weeks and this is the WORST customer service, hands down, we’ve ever encountered. Vell - you are in the wrong line of work and the Green Tortoise should be ashamed to have someone like that on their otherwise great & friendly team. We stayed in a private room, it’s was on the 3rd floor and was adequate. Bed was not the greatest but did the job. The bathrooms are great and they even offer shampoo/conditioner/soap. We didn’t eat at the breakfasts as our schedule didn’t allow but in my past stay it was great.

Rooms are what you expect from an hostel, plenty bathrooms (enough for never have to wait), free breakfast in the beautiful saloon where you can meet other travelers and enjoy night activities. I will forever and ever come back there when I come to San Francisco. The prices might look a bit high, but it is so worth it you won't regret it for a second. The area is beautiful, is quite fun that you cannot smoke in front of the hostel but don't worry, there are handy stairs nearby the hostel.

1565,"So, I am a wrinkly old coot of 63; the sort one just doesn't see that often in a hostel. I found the staff to be enthusiastic and efficient. They are accomplished in the art of banter and laughed at my jokes---this always earns a couple of extra stars. The facility is clean and well maintained throughout, and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast is scheduled for 7:30, but coffee was ready much earlier. Thank you. The dining area is spacious which let guests spread out for quiet and privacy. There was also an assortment of old well used guitars to play before hitting the pavement. Also, very nice.The layout was simple for adequate to fuel up for a day of walking the city. Now, the North Beach location, a few steps away from the intersection of Kearny and Broadway is excellent as I like the neighborhood. My literary themed walk took me to City Lights Books and Cafe Trieste where I communed with the ghostly presence of Ginsberg, Kerouac, and the other beats.

1567,"I had booked a private room. For the price you pay for a centrally located hostel in comparison with normal hotels it is a okay deal.Very friendly and accomodating staff, had good tips of where to go and how to get there. They are interested in how you are and how your day was. The breakfast is limited for the price paid. Also the exact same breakfast is there every day, which isn't really special. And served a little late (07:30) in the morning. Early starters need to find breakfast elsewhere or make your own.The room I was in (29B), has a window facing the hallway. The curtains aren't thick enough to block that light from illuminating the room. That should be fixed, as rooms to sleep in should be really dark.Other than that the room was clean and the bed comfortabele with a locker box that holds a suitcase and a trolley underneath the bed. Showers are kept clean and provide enough water at a good hot temperature. And there was always one available for your needs.Other guests could consider sleeping guests a bit more, woke up at night when conversations were finished in the hallway.Other than those few points, I really had a nice stay and would consider them for a future visit.",18-Apr-18,"27    Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco

They had good breakfast options, with bagels (choice of spread- cheese/butter/peanut butter), juices, milk, eggs that you cook by yourself. One thing that I liked was that they already mentioned on their site about the noise that would be there at night from the street. Location of the hostel is perfect, very near to Fisherman's Wharf, Chinatown, Telegraph hill, etc.The only thing that was a concern(just on the very first day because I had not expected it) was that though the hostel was centrally located, the block it was on was full of strip clubs.

1583,"The Green Tortoise is largely a place for the younger folks, ones who are generally more agreeable to bunk room situations. I'm not, but the Green Tortoise does have about five single rooms in a separate building, just a couple of blocks from the main building. I chose one of those room. The bed was comfortable and the sharing the bath was not an issue.My room had two large windows that opened. I love that! With a double / queen bed in a room designed for something smaller, it was a little tough getting out of your own way, but I understand that putting in the larger bed probably makes more sense. There was a box fan in the room, but it was not needed. Just as well because it was filthy. I have little patience for neglected and very obvious maintenance items. The bath has a rod that holds three rolls of toilet paper. All were empty, and there was a separate roll on the windowsill. I had noticed the afternoon before that the rolls were empty. I think we can agree that's a big no-no. Check-in was easy and friendly. Since the room was in a separate building, someone walked me over to it. There was a (big sigh) tip jar on the check-in counter! No, no, no, i'm not going to tip you for checking me in! For a place like the Green Tortoise, who goes to lengths to be fun, the presence of a tip jar for checking you in is a mite pretentious. (If the place were the Hotel Costa Plenty, instead of the Green Tortoise, I'd be equally annoyed.) I was looking forward to the breakfast in the morning - the ""hostel feel"". Everyone had to cook their own breakfast. Maybe there were other items to cook, but all I saw were eggs. After cooking your breakfast, then you clean the dishes you just used. Even with just four or five people cooking or cleaning, it was literal case of ""too many cooks in the kitchen."" I found it terribly impractical and very poorly laid out. Even small considerations such as ""where is a cup for the coffee?"" was more challenging than it needed to be.",20-Sep-17,"27    Green Tortoise Hostel - San Francisco

1586,"I was a bit hesitant to book this place at first given the photographs of the property as it looked a bit dated. Typically we like to stay in a little higher end places but this just seemed to be a colossal waste of money given the price of hotel suites in San Francisco. With that being said, I was pleasantly surprised with the accommodations at the suites at fisherman‘s wharf. We were given a one bedroom unit on the first floor with a city view in fact right across from world famous restaurant Gary Danko (If we were on the 3rd floor we would be able to see the bay, but it seems that all of the units are obstructed views except the very top floor). There is a fabulous balcony area on the roof with great views over the bay. Our unit certainly did look dated but was clean and adequate for our needs. The location was truly amazing you are only One block from Ghirardelli Square and a short walk to the waterfront fisherman’s wharf area, and literally right on the cable car line.

The king bed is comfortable with plenty of pillows. Everything is impeccably clean. We can hear the occupants above us occasionally because the floor squeaks in places, but it's not intrusive. This speaks to the age of the building. Had they not been so considerate, there could have been a problem. The location is excellent.

The property was chosen on the basis of its location and the fact that, for the same price as a room-only basis hotel in the area, it had its own kitchenette. We were accommodated in room 101 on the 1st floor, a one bedroom apartment. Check-in was swift and everything in the apartment was clean, tidy and working which was what just we needed after a long flight. We did not hear too much noise as other reviewers have noted, it appears we were lucky that our fellow guests were a quiet, respectful bunch. There is no kettle, some pictures show a kettle that can be placed on the 2 ring stove plate but our apartment did not have one. Fortunately we had our travel kettle but at 110 volts it takes ages to boil! There is a coffee machine and a combi microwave oven as well as a toaster and a large fridge. The location of the SF Suites is good for access to Fishermans Wharf, Ghiradelli Square is a block away as is the Buena Vista Café. There is a posh restaurant across the street, many options in Ghiradelli Square and loads more cheaper options at the Wharf itself. 5 blocks away is a Safeway supermarket where we stocked up on breakfast items. 1 block away is the start of the Hyde-Powell cable car line – best to get on here.

It is on the corner of Hyde St and North Point St. It is 2 blocks to Ghiradelli Square and a walkable distance to Fisherman's Wharf. There is a cable car stop and bus stop right by the building. We used the on site parking for $22 per day with in and out privileges. Compared to other hotels I looked into when booking this trip, the parking is a steal! The parking area is little so parking a big truck or SUV could be tricky. The room was good. It was clean and had a spacious living room with a pull out bed. The room decorating was a bit dated. The bathroom looked to be freshly remodeled. A downside was the lack of bathroom fan. The room was very humid and steamy after showering. Above the shower was a small window to the hallway. Opening the window helped with the steam but if you were sitting on the toilet with the window open, the people walking on the floor above could potentially look right at you! Needless to say, we rarely had the window open. The other downside is that at times, we could easily hear our upstairs neighbors. The day we arrived we planned on going to sleep early but the room above was still awake. We could hear them walking around and the children talking. There is a roof top patio with a few tables with a great view. Overall, a comfortable place to stay. It is an excellent location at a reasonable price. ",2-Apr-19,"28    Suites at Fisherman's Wharf

The rooms are spacious and well appointed. All was clean, in order and well serviced. It’s nice to have the cooking facilities should they be wanted. Service at the front desk was courteous and helpful. The only reason to score a 4 and not a 5 was the noise that was transmitted from the room above.

1600,"I stayed there with my wife and 2 children (2 & 5) in late October for 9 days, and we found it very well suited to our needs. It really is a great location, right where you need to be so any travelling to see attractions, though necessary in a large city, is minimized.What I really liked about the rooms was the space. There was a large lounge and bedroom, and although the bathroom and kitchen were smaller, they were just fine for our needs. The staff were also very helpful, and anything we asked for was quickly attended to.There were two large televisions (lounge and bedroom) with plenty of channels, and a large fridge/freezer. The view across the Bay to Alcatraz from the balcony was a nice extra feature.If I had a moan, I would say that the decor was somewhat dated and a little old, and the kitchen could do with an update in terms of the units weren't of the best quality. But I would emphasize that this in no way impacted on the quality of our stay.It isn't the upmarket, modern,type of place you would get at a large modern hotel chain, but it is a well located, spacious, and enjoyable space to stay . I read some negative reviews claiming that the 'heavy doors to the lift were a fire hazard', and I really have no idea what that was talking about, these criticisms are absolute rubbish in every way.This place deserves the high rating it currently enjoys.",7-Nov-18,"28    Suites at Fisherman's Wharf

1602,"The Suites at Fisherman’s Wharf is at the corner of Hyde and North Point. The cable cars run along Hyde and the buses, along North Point. Thus making it an ideal location, transportation wise. It is also a short distance from Ghirardelli Square. Although the cable car stops right in front of the hotel, it is best to take it from the terminus, a short distance downhill, if you need a seat. You can also get your tickets/passes at the terminus. This hotel has one or two bedrooms, mainly one-bedroom. Parking is self parking and cost $25/day. Self laundry costs $1.50 per load. There is a lookout patio on the 4th floor where one can see Alcatraz and the surrounding area. Hyde St Pier is within walking distance. This hotel is not very big but the staff is nice and friendly.

1604,"Overall, it's a pleasant hotel. I enjoyed my stay. I felt the hotel staff was pleasant and accommodating. The location is fabulous. The only downsides were the late checkin (4:00 is quite late) and the elevator not staying on the floor if you didn't enter right away. One may wonder why this is an issue. The elevator door doesn't open. It's an old-fashioned elevator, where you need to open the door. So, if you are distracted at all and don't see the elevator coming, through the small window, you might miss it. It immediately goes back to the main floor. I think they should get rid of the outer doors so one can see when the elevator comes or, if they can, change the elevator behavior so it waits until someone else calls it. For one or two nights, the elevator is charming, but for a longer stay, it becomes annoying.Regarding the late checkin, I feel 4:00 is quite late as a checkin time and they were not at all accommodating about an earlier checking, even if informed ahead of time that I was coming and needed access to the refrigerator. They also did not have my allergies noted in the record, despite having been called a week beforehand to have them noted.So, 4 stars is appropriate. The overall experience was excellent, but they do have room for improvement.",3-Sep-18,"28    Suites at Fisherman's Wharf

1605,This location is situated two blocks north of the bay. It is within easy walking distance to all of the Wharf activities and transportation. The resort itself is the problem. Actions in rooms above the room can be heard thru the ceilings. Shower activities can be heard thru a false window into a common area. Queen sofa bed mattresses are too thin. There is a heavy door covering the elevator door which presents a fire escape hazard. Parking is limited and too close to park comfortably. Fee charged to park is ridiculous.

The negatives were its slightly dated decor and appliances and the lack of light in the rooms.

If you can't get a room with a view along the front (North Pt) or side (Hyde St) you may be in for a dim time. Having access to the roof terrace would help, but unfortunately this was not available for us in February due to renovations on the terrace.

1634,"I booked a one-night stay for me, my wife, and our 17-year old daughter. The facility is hard to find and does not look at all like a hotel from the street (which is not a big deal; just worth a mention). When I went to check in, I was greeted by Jason at the front desk, who confirmed my reservation, took credit card details for incidentals, and gave me the card keys for the room. After taking the tiny elevator (for those who are at all claustrophobic), we entered our room to find it was a one-bedroom suite instead of the two-bedroom suite we had booked and prepaid. I immediately went down to the front desk and spoke with Jason, and showed him the itinerary confirming we had booked and paid for a two-bedroom suite. Jason said ""oh, you booked through Expedia,"" and then said that Expedia describes the room we were given as a ""two-bedroom suite"" because the sofa folds out into a queen-size bed and there is a separate bedroom. Although I was fairly certain that Jason was lying, it was late, we were tired, and my wife and daughter said not to make a big deal of it. After we returned home, I verified that there are indeed two-bedroom suites as well as one-bedroom suites, and there is a significant price difference of sixty bucks per night between the two. I immediately wrote to both Expedia and the hotel group, but over seven months later have not received a refund.",4-Aug-17,"28    Suites at Fisherman's Wharf

Close to harbour, bike rental (use Alcatraz bike tours - brilliant), trams stop right outside, short walk for breakfast and good choices to pick from. Restaurants a short walk away and a good selection too. 20 minutes stroll to the Italian area.It also has a good roof terrace looking out towards Alcatraz and harbour. Couple of down sides. One, the walls aren't that well insulated so hearing noisy neighbours with less consideration than others could be an issue. Two, the pull out sofa bed needs replacing. It's knackered and broken.

The lift is very small and doors are awkward to operate if you have larger luggage. The sofa bed is horribly uncomfortable for an adult. But my main complaint is the ludicrous check in time of 4pm. I don't want to spend hours on the road to arrive at the hotel to be told to go for a walk, I want to settle in and relax. The explanation was that they are a small hotel so it's hard to get all the rooms prepped. Here's a suggestion for the management genius running the place, employ more staff! Don't give me a boring story about getting things perfect, it's not the Ritz for heaven's sake.

Suites should have informed us of the noise issue, both in person and on their website. Several other complaints were voiced during the visit, but none could be handled by the staff. At check-out, I reviewed my stay and the issues encountered, but no adjustment could be made. When I inquired several days later, I was told that all complaints had to be brought forward during the visit, and nothing could be done afterwards.

1647,"GENERALWe been to San Francisco many times, as it is one of our favorite cities, so stayed 7-nights over spring break with family, in a 2-bedroom timeshare condo exchanged through Interval International. LOCATION and PUBLIC TRANSPORTATIONThe condo is in the perfect location, one block from Ghirardelli Square. About a 5-minute walk to the Wharf area and 10-minute walk to Pier 39. Public transportation is so convenient—the Powell-Hyde cable car and MUNI buses both have stops literally right outside the front door! Grocery store (Safeway and Trader Joes) are 5 blocks away. Get yourself a MUNI pass (1, 3, 7 day) which will let you get around the city; note it does not cover BART, which is the train to/from SFO. We picked up our 7-day pass ($42 each) at information booth in baggage claim. Don’t forget to also pick up a $3 MUNI map with bus/cable car routes.PARKINGWe rented a car so we could visit family in Sacramento and took a couple of other day trips during our stay. There is limited parking (about 15 spots for 25 condos). Parking is $22 a day. If you are lucky (like us), once you get your spot, you have it the rest of your stay. If not, supposedly you can park in a nearby (more expensive) public lot temporarily until a spot opens later during your stay. If are not planning to leave the city, DON’T bother with a car; you’ll just pay a lot for parking.LIKES* Renovated, good-size condo, especially for SF. Very clean.* Beds: 1 king-size, 1 queen-size, large sofa bed. * Roof-top terrace with gorgeous unobstructed view of the bay and Alcatraz* 2 washers & dryers near lobby ($1.50 each), though 1 dryer was broken* Large in-room safe* Kitchen: 2-burner, fridge, toaster, microwave, blender, dishwasher, dishes and utensilsNEUTRAL* Older building so doors, cabinet and floors creaked* Small, simple lobby. Small business center (computer, printer)* No traditional oven—microwave is also a convection oven* No A/C, although did not need it in April* Minor sales pitch for their timeshare, which we declined with no further pressureDISLIKES* Quite noisy (NOT condo’s fault) because you are next to cable line!* Quite dark in living room* Beds not very comfortable* Bath tub clogged; told front desk but was not fixed* Large master bedroom closet but none in 2nd bedroom and no drawers for clothes* Free Wi-Fi very slow (<1 Mps).

1668,"Our family of 4 stayed in a one-bedroom suite for 9 nights of vacation. We were very happy with our choice overall. We have two boys (15 and 11) and wanted enough space. We typically stay at Hilton type hotels on vacation for that reason. Hotels are so expensive here that we were priced out of suites or taking 2 rooms. We looked at VRBO, but didn't find any in as good a location as The Suites at Fisherman's Wharf. Plus it's nice to have the reassurance of 24 hr front desk for any problems and cleaning, etc.Loved that we were close to wharf activities without being in the center of tacky souvenir shops and all the noise. You are 1 block into the neighborhood of Russian Hill which feels less touristy. Buses and Cable car right on hotel corner. The stop for The street car to wharf and ferry building is a 5-10 minute walk.Loved our balcony and the roof top deck to enjoy a bottle of wine and the incredible views! So great to enjoy the San Francisco air and vibe and not be in a tiny sealed hotel room. Also loved having coin operated laundry downstairs, so we didn't have to overpack or waste money on cleaning service.Areas of improvement? Well my kids were bummed there was no pool, but we knew that going in. The rollaway bed wasn't available until our 2nd night. The pull out and rollaway weren't the best, but with smaller kids it would be fine.The housekeeping was appreciated, but minimal. I.e never changed pull-out sheets, changed our bed once, but always had fresh towels and was tidy.The staff was eager to please and helpful with suggestions.I recommend it!

1670,"Stayed here with young kids. Location is perfect. Just a short walking distance from Wharf and bus/trolleys just outside the front door. Kitchen was fully stocked with necessities. Kids enjoyed the ""old fashioned"" elevator. The place is older and appears to have been painted over many times (interior door frames, etc). Our room was clean but outdated and appeared so. Stayed on upper floor so did not have any ""thin wall"" noise issues. Being we had a great view of the bay, and transportation stop is right outside, we did hear the busses and cars traveling all night but got used to the noise. Had room vacuumed and trash emptied upon request, as well as more towels, soaps refilled, etc. My only complaint is the odor. I could not get used to the old, wet wood, musty odor. It just smells old. My family wasn't as bothered by it as I was although it has bothered me enough to rethink my stay here again. It is clean, and plenty spacious, just smelly.

The free breakfast (early AM, ends at 9:30am) and round-the-clock coffee in the dining area (2nd flr, by the gym where you can refill your free water bottle at the water cooler) was awesome! Typical continental breakfast including pre-made omelettes, sausages, cereals, various milks, yogurts and fruits. Also, complimentary fruit infused water available in the lobby's snack shop.Clean guestroom and the use of space was smart; the bathroom is pretty big actually! We were out all Sat at Union Sq and Dolo -- we really love this location, so central for most of what we visited! The hotel is surrounded by hotels, eateries including several boba and other Asian delectables, and the brand name stores of Union Sq.

Super staff all around, from the friendly front desk to housekeeping, who keep the place spotlessly clean. The location couldn't be better. Two blocks from Union Square, the Cable Car, and the Powell Street station, making it easy to reach from SFO using BART. All sorts of restaurants, bars and cafes in the immediate area, and you can walk to Chinatown and North Beach in 15-20 minutes for delicious food.Sadly I have to take off a star on this review for the appalling amount of waste that is generated in the breakfast room. Especially the plastic cutlery and non-recyclable cups. Yes, they offer paper plates, but those will also end up in a landfill. There is absolutely no reason not to be using dishware and cutlery that can be washed and used again.

Are you going to charge me the daily parking fee regardless? There is no guidance for guests who have even have a vehicle. Is there a valet? Do we self park? Did they assume we took a Lyft/Uber/taxi to the hotel? Secondly, the room was extremely dusty. I wondered if it had been vacuumed recently it was so bad. Lastly, I provided and confirmed my Stay Preferences in advance. With four adults listed on the reservation and as requested in my Stay Preferences, there should be four, full sets of towels. There was an odd number of each: (3) bath towels; (4) hand towels; and (2) washcloths; thus, forcing me to call and wait for additional to be brought to the room.

I reminded him, that I was a gold member; but no mercy, except he could grant a late check-out at 1:00 p.m. Arrived in my room, which had no safe. All cups and mugs were made of plastic. Also the breakfast restaurant had plastic mugs as well as plastic cutlery. Ironically, the hotel reminds guests, that it cares about the environment and therefore recommends guests to use towels and linens again, in order to save detergent and the environment. What an irony.My bed was extremely soft, indeed too soft and no good for my back. I did not sleep that night for this reason. The following morning I informed the receptionist, this time a young woman, about the extremely soft bed. She told me, that I could change the room, but said that probably all beds are the same.

I took the opportunity to ask the receptionist, if she could extend my late check-out until 3:00 pm. She could not, although she granted a late check-out at 2:00 pm. Ironically, after my first night, the room was not cleaned until after 3:30 pm (I left my shopping bags in my room at 3:30 pm, at which time my room was not cleaned).

On the negative side, this hotel is located only 2 blocks from the Tenderloin and the area was inundated with people on the sidewalks begging. The streets were soiled with urine and the air was foul each morning. We saw city workers out sanitizing, but it is a huge job. We were warned not to walk west from the hotel at any time of the day.

The gym is small, but they do have one. Breakfast isn't elaborate but it's adequate with some hot food like eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits, pancakes and cold food such as yogurt. There's also pastries, juice, coffee, cereal, toast, bananas, apples, etc. There's a Walgreens around the corner which was really helpful as we saved a lot of money grabbing drinks and snacks there; we even grabbed lunch there several times which left more money for nice dinners.

There is an extra charge for parking. I later noticed that there is a public car park over the road which is probably cheaper, certainly worth looking into.

1700,"From our title, the biggest beef we had with this hotel was it doesn’t offer any laundry service which was a bit of a problem for us as we were traveling from an international location and had limited time available. We ended up finding an online laundry service that would pick up and deliver to the hotel, I would’ve thought the hotel could do a deal with a laundry service like that to fill that gap. The hotel is in a great location near Union Square which makes for easy restaurant selection as there are many nearby. We had the King Suite as my wife and I were traveling with our 2 teenage boys, the room was a little tight for all of us and our luggage but the reality was we didn’t spend a lot of time in the room anyway. I’d recommend this hotel if you don’t need all of the extras like room service etc. The hotel does offer breakfast which includes the usual basic offerings, better than spending big bucks for a bowl of cereal at a full service hotel.",21-Aug-18,"29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

They were able to satisfy my request of being on a higher floor; however, the the noise from the street can easily be heard from the top floor (5th floor). If you’re a light sleeper then this hotel is probably not for you. Unless you get a room towards the top, back, and off the street. Breakfast was the typical for a hotel that offers free continental breakfast. It did the trick. The room was very clear, but I thought the shower floor could have used some extra cleaning. The grout looked a bit dirty. The hotel is in a pretty decent location close to Union Square. If you don’t mind walking, then it’s a nice walk to different neighborhoods. Beware that it’s close to the sketchy neighborhood, but you shouldn’t be bothered unless you specifically walk through the Tenderloin neighborhood to the west.

After booking 7 nights, but not prepaid, we requested to leave 2 nights early, we were told we had to lose a full nights stay in order to do so. After complaining of the unfairness, we were then told we had to pay a $100 early departure fee which was never communicated verbally nor in hotel reservation confirmation. After calling to IHG to get support, hotel management then agreed to waive the early departure fee. In addition the hotel is in a very noisy area and sits atop an Irish pub that is extremely loud to the point of disrupting Sleep nightly, but especially on Saturday nights when the music plays to 2 am. After complaining to hotel management about excessive noise, their solution was to offer ear plugs to sleep in. We requested a partial refund for the night we wereunable to sleep and the hotel management refused. When we complained, the General Manager was not on property but said he would respond within 48 hours. We needed an immediate response, not a delay of 48 hours, as were would check out with 24 hours.Again, it was necessary to contact IHG to receive their assistancein resolving this matter, they had a case manager assigned that was very helpful in resolving this matter for us.

After an exhaustive search I ended up selecting the holiday inn express, union square and I haven’t looked back, I now wander around San Fran marvelling at my choice looking at the tacky looking 3 and 4 star hotels most of which costs at least 50% more, San Fran is a really expensive place. The hotel is located around 2/3 mins from Union square. The rooms are clean, well maintained and serviced, the shower is quite large and no mound in the grout. Staff are also very pleasant. Breakfast is included and this is really useful if you are looking to save on costs, it is undersold on their website and actually includes a really good variety for which you can get a good fill that will last until mid afternoon. You can also usually pop back into the breakfast room to get a coffee or tea at any point during the day (not evenings or night).Room tip:Get at least the third floor as on certain days you can hear music from downstairs however, it isn’t on until late and you should be out enjoying the cityBooking tip:Register with TopCashback then book through hotels.com.

When we arrived we've been warmly welcomed by reception staff and checked in. Hotel staff realised we were exhausted from our flight so they made it quick and sufficient. We've booked a basic room but were surprised of the high quality standard and cleanliness. After a little wander through town we were welcomed back and went to our room. After a good night sleep (very comfy bed) we headed down for breakfast and again were surprised with plenty of choice. From hot buffet items like scrambled egg and bacon to cereals and a fridge filled with yoghurts and fresh milk there was everything you needed to have a good start of your day. Very helpful reception staff which always went the extra mile and helped where they could. Every time we enter the hotel we were greeted and welcomed back. Sorry didn't get your names but you were brilliant. Would I recommend it? Definitely!

1738,"I was recently forced to modify my 3-night hotel booking twice due to flight cancellations (climate conditions), and this change resulted in a rate increase of over USD300 total from my initial reservation and the new one. I contacted the manager and told him I fully understood how room rates fluctuated on a daily basis, however, given this particular situation, where niether party had control over weather factors, I kindly suggested him to consider a middle point where I would be charged 50% of the rate increase so niether the hotel nor myself would be totally affected by what had happened. It´s worth mentioning I also told him the rate I had originally booked, was a non refundable one,and that I felt frustrated to have to assume the 100% rate increase when it was not a change I personally requested, but rather forced to do so.His blunt answer was the hotel could not honor the rate adjustment due to conventions in the area during that week. With this answer, he completely disregarded my situation, and missed the opportunity to actually demostrate real customer care. In the end, it felt like the hotel took adavantage of the situation since I did not have another accommodation option to look for, but rather accept the rate increase or loose all my money. I didn´t let this ruin my stay (the rest of the staff was very cordial and professional), but it will definitely be my last one at a Holiday Inn chain hotel.",26-Sep-17,"29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

1740,"We selected this hotel for proximity to our friend’s hotel. In our research we saw that it received high marks from visitors. We are in agreement that this is a nice hotel. The hotel was clean, the breakfast was pretty good and the staff was amazing. Each and every one was very friendly and helpful. It is close to the F Line to get to Fisherman’s Wharf. A short walk will get you to some very nice shopping. There is a ton of construction in this area which limits mobility a bit but hey when is there not construction in San Francisco?!? The only thing keeping a 5 rating is that for the last two nights of our stay they didn’t provide any wash cloths with rest of the linens. Not sure why and no explanation provided. Maybe it’s not a big deal for most but we like showering with wash cloths . Otherwise a very pleasant stay and we would certainly return.

1741,"I gave this a one star rating because the two reception staff actually earned it.We looked online for a reasonable 24 Hour stay between flights in transit from USA for our Australian return. We were two women travelling alone, and after confronting issues after Hurricane Irma, we had our travel plans turned into disarray.We did not have a lot of time to put a lot of strategy for hotels after leaving Florida with a diversion into Canada before this unexpected stop.We fortunately arrived in the daytime into perhaps the worst side of the city,confronted with homeless people and bad shop fronts. We stepped into the lobby which was basically not much more than a matchbox and spoke with the 2 reception staff about our feelings of the location.We had paid a deposit online of one nights stay UD $270. After seeing two rooms, we asked if we could transfer our money to another hotel of the same chain IHG (Intercontinental) The first room had a faulty cloth Blind on the window and was unusable. It could not be fixed after staff were sent up on our arrival. The second room, like the other, had an unusual odour. The bedrooms offered an attractive bed with white linen plus a clean, perhaps newly renovated bathroom. On the downside, there was no room whatsoever to leave our cases except between the bed and side walls, and would have to stay closed at all times. We decided that security was at a risk because there was no safe except at reception, with a dubious situation that they locked their doors from 10pm each night due to the unsafe area.The staff also confirmed we were correct in our assumption, and we would have been at risk if we turned left and not right leaving the lobby into the street. After an hour of unsuccessful bidding for a fair and justifiable situation with the receptionist speaking online with their Manager Raj, it was non negotiable even though we were members with so called benefits.We then decided to take a taxi to the Fairmont and it was a huge relief to go to a safe location.As we would have had to walk the city with our passports and valuables, also no facilities we could use, we believe that we may have turned an unforeseen unsavoury situation into a total positive by leaving this hotel.All in all, do yourself a favour, and do not consider this hotel nor this Chain of hotels as there is no loyalty whatsoever to members, and even more so to basic travellers.It is a HUGE NO from us!",18-Sep-17,"29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

1743,"Stayed 2 nights. Finding the hotel was interesting. You cannot park your vehicle in front of the hotel to unload your luggage. Front desk staff directed me to park where indicated just around the corner (valet stop at Cyril Magnin Street and O'Farrell Street). You'll see a sign indicating where to park. Note: Valet parking is currently $55 / night plus tax of $13.75.Location is fantastic! Especially if you love to shop! I selected this hotel primarily based on the following factors: its proximity to Union Square shopping; its proximity to catching the cable cars; and complimentary breakfast.This hotel is located very close to Macy's (on the next block) and is a short walking distance to Westfield San Francisco shopping centre and other fun places to shop. Starbucks and Boudin Bakery are quite close. Walgreens and Trader Joe's are also not too far.The Powell and Market cable car turnaround is nearby.Ask for a room on a higher floor and away from the elevator if you are a light sleeper. As other reviewers have indicated, there is a pub next door. I did not hear any street noise as I requested a room on a higher floor.I only wish our room had a safe and a luggage rack.A special thank you to John N - Front Desk Manager.

1744,"Visited the San Francisco for the first time recently, and stressed about the right hotel. After doing a bit of research we chose this hotel and we were sooooooo pleased! The hotel staff couldnt have been more helpful (Susan at the front desk is always ready to help out), the hotel is sparkeling clean, and the location is fantastic. Easy on/off isf you want to use public transportation, and centrally located for all taxi/uber service. Lots of great resturants around, easy walking distance. The only bad news, is like many hotels in downtown San Francisco you can expect small room sizes, and a fair amount of traffic noise. But, if you want to be in the center of it all, you just have to be ok with that. On a final note, the continental free breakfast here was really nice in comparison to a lot of other hotels I've stayed at.

1747,"This is a very new, modern, clean, energy efficient hotel near Union Square. Signage is a little limited, so it can be hard to find at first. Rooms range in size from very small to larger.

1748,"This property has a lot going for it. It has two queen beds in the rooms, a rarity in San Francisco, where full beds are the norm. We were staying for five nights with two kids and appreciated the extra room. The hotel is relatively new and feels like it. Very sleek and urban, not imposing the cookie cutter approach more common in suburban Holiday Inn Express locations. The Wi-Fi was consistently reliable and strong. The breakfast room is compact, though well-stocked and kept clean. Margarita provided friendly service there. In fact, all of the staffer met was both affable and helpful. Main knock and could be a deal breaker for some: the hotel is right next to a pub that often has live music. You'll hear it. Management knows that but is powerless to do anything about it. We eventually fell asleep, but at times it took some doing. Our kids were too exhausted at the end of the night to be bothered. At the end of the day you have a good hotel in a great location. Just know who your neighbors are. You'll be getting to know them when the sun goes down. ",1-Sep-17,"29    Holiday Inn Express San Francisco Union Square

1750,"Really nothing about this hotel worth raving about...not that an HIE ever warrants a rave, but I've stayed in a few that were surprisingly clean and well appointed. This one, while fairly new, is just ""meh."" Signage is poor...2 taxis and an Uber thought I didn't know where I was going because they'd driven by it 100 times and had never seen it. Lobby is small, stark and sparse...who cares? No biggie...just saying. Room was good sized and well appointed.,,but be advised: I was on the highest floor (5th) and was nearly thumped out of my bed on Saturday night. Why? Because the adjacent pub host live music every night...but especially rollicking on Saturday. It goes on 'til 2am. I'm not opposed to a rocking good time...still, pack ear plugs....and even then I'm not sure it'll block the bass and drums. Breakfast...is served in a small room next to the small fitness area on the 2nd floor. (From a traffic and aroma standpoint, I was glad my room wasn't on that floor.) Breakfast itself was typical powdered eggs, sausage and a few cereals...Coffee was decent tho.Staff was plenty friendly. Location: Okay...Close to Union Square but SF is so overrun with homeless that I don't know where'd you stay to avoid the walking triage.
